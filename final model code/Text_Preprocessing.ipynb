The most likely cause for your symptoms is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a type of peripheral vertigo. In this condition, the most common symptom is dizziness or giddiness, which is made worse with movements. Accompanying nausea and vomiting are common. The condition is due to problem in the ear, and improves in a few days on own. Betahistine tablets would help relieve your symptoms. Doing vestibular rehabilitation or adaptation exercises would prevent the recurrence of these symptoms. An ENT evaluation would also help. I hope it helps. Best wishes, Chat Doctor. ',\n",

It seems your kid is having viral diarrhea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhea.

              " '<human>: Hello, My husband is taking Oxycodone due to a broken leg/surgery. He has been taking this pain medication for one month. We are trying to conceive our second baby. Will this medication afect the fetus? Or the health of the baby? Or can it bring birth defects? Thank you.\\n<bot>: Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First, there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive.  Medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant. The only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like Oxycodone do not have this effect. So there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication.  The best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects. I hope this answers your question and best wishes for your upcoming pregnancy,',\n",

Also I have bern experiencing stomach pains that prevent me from eating. I immediatly feel full and have extreme pain. Please help\\n<bot>: HI. You have two different problems. The lump under the nipple should be removed, biopsied. This will help you to get rid of the disease, and you get a diagnosis. Second problem looks a bit serious one: Pain that prevents you from eating-immediate fullness, and extreme pain. I would advise such a patient to undergo the upper GI endoscopy asap. This can be an ulcer with a problem at the pylorus. The exact diagnosis is the most important to start the right therapy. Do not waste time in starting the therapy.',\n",

I would suggest that you see your doctor. Your baby maybe having bronchiolitis which is a lung infection common to your kids age. It is commonly caused by a virus. Albuterol via nebulization should be utilized in order to alleviate the wheezing and also help with the congestion. A decongestant can also be used for the colds.

There might be having osteomalacia or osteoporosis as well. Go for x-ray lumbosacral region for osteoarthritis. Physiotherapy like back extension exercises will be much helpful.

              " '<human>: sir, MY uncle has ILD-Interstitial Lung disease.from my research over google i found that the cause is important to be known. the cause wat i feel is due to breakage of acid bottle in bathroom which caused lot of smoke and that time he wasnot able to be normal for 15-20 minutes. then he was normal .may be that would have been the reason for this ILD. Please suggest wat we should do\\n<bot>: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. OLD (interstitial lung disease) can not be caused by single exposure of any chemical. Chronic exposure (for years) of chemicals can cause OLD. It is not possible to find out cause for each and every OLD patient. Some patients can develop OLD just because of aging (old age). So your uncle is not having OLD due to breakage of acid bottle. He might be having age related OLD. Better to start Perfinodone and N acetyl cysteine (NAC) for OLD rather than searching for cause. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your uncle. Thanks.',\n",

It could be a blood collection due to minor injury or a vein rupture which is also common at this age.

I appreciate your concern towards H pylori infection which normally causes break in the lining of the stomach (peptic ulcer). H pylori is an exceptional bacterium which can survive in the acidic environment of the stomach producing tissue damage result in ulcer.

Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. Understood the history well. You have an obvious reason for pain - the adhesions and scar must have reformed. But the history of Dyspareunia, meaning painful sex indicated the is some active inflammatory process still going on in the pelvis called PID-Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. Cystitis and Procto-colitis are the additional problems causing the pain in abdomen and rectum before and during bowel movements as also during urination. Ovarian cyst can cause problem only if it enlarges fast or gets twisted.

Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause burning in chest. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic Chat Doctor.  4. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 5. Quit smoking and alcohol if you have these habits. Lose weight if you are obese. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\",\n",

Thanks for your query, read and understood your problems. You are getting bouts of pain in the upper abdomen within the last 2 years particularly after the gall bladder surgery. This is great news that cardiac problems are ruled out by the tests every time in the emergency Room. This means that we have to find a local cause in the abdomen itself. I would suggest the following:Get Ct scan and MRCP for the hepato-biliary- pancreatic system. Also go for upper GI Endoscopy to rule out Gastric ulcer. Cancer. Colonoscopy for the possible problem of the colon in this area. If required a diagnostic Laparoscopy may help to see or rule out the intestinal adhesion due to bands or kinking or so and can be tackled at the same time. This way a final diagnosis and treatment plan can be done to get you permanent results.',\n",

Pilonidal dimple not transformed into sinus [beginning stage where pain/discharge is not there], so the best management which can be done at home is: keep the area clean and hygienic2. Do not use a cotton bud to scratch, clean or put into hole.3. It could be pressure sore due to prolonged sitting, or old infected boil which opened and left a big hole, thus Opinion/Examination is needed PS. Take care, not at home, but after surgical evaluation and exploration.',\n",

I am a senior at Clemson University and to be honest the apartment where I resided in the past four months was extremely unsanitary.

Tetanus is a bacterial disease by clostridium retain. There is no cure for tetanus, but it can be prevented by adequate vaccination. Usual symptoms are all due to painful contraction of muscles as it affects our nervous system.

I would have been able to help u better had you mentioned your age. You have complaints of chest pain radiating to back with strong family history. So in your case it is better that we evaluate you for presence of heart disease. I recommend an ECG and 2d echo initially. If both these tests are normal you can proceed for a treadmill test which requires you to walk on a treadmill while your ECG is continuously monitored. This will show if the heart blood supply suffers while you are exercising which indirectly predicts whether you have blockages in your heart. Please do the above tests and revert.

You have to do x-ray chest as early as possible. Rib fractures can cause pneumothorax/air in chest or hemothorax/blood in the chest which will be seen on x-ray.

Lower back pain may cause by right lumber disc prolapse whicChatDoctorpresses the nerve. But exact other causes are diagnosed by physical examination or by MRI. Common causes of lower backache and leg pain is a lumbar ruptured disc or herniated disc. Symptoms of a herniated disc may include dull or sharp pain, muscle spasm or cramping, sciatica, and leg weakness or loss of leg function. Sneezing, coughing, or bending usually intensify the pain. Rarely bowel or bladder control is lost, and if this occurs, seek medical attention at once. Sciatica is a symptom frequently associated with a lumbar herniated disc. Pressure on one or several nerves that contribute to the sciatic nerve can cause pain, burning, tingling, and numbness that extends from the buttock into the leg and sometimes into the foot. Usually one side (left or right) is affected. Take care ',\n",

My boyfriend and i have been using the pullout method frequently before and after stopping the pill. Could i be pregnant?\\n<bot>: Hallow Dear, Since you are no more on the birth control pills now, you are no more having any contraceptive protection. Pull out technique is not a safe and reliable technique for contraception. In this method, the penis is pulled out of vagina before the ejaculation takes place. However, before ejaculation, pre-seminal or pre-ejaculatory secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum does contain some sperms which are capable of impregnating a woman. Now that you have missed your period, please get your pregnancy test done on overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier, the test may report false negative. Alternatively, you may perform Beta Chat Doctor test on the blood. This will help you detect your pregnancy status. If you are not pregnant, you may take some progestational preparation like Devilry for 5 days (with advice of a Gynecologist). Then within 4-7 days, you should get with Chat Doctor.  However, if you are pregnant, you may opt for medical termination of pregnancy. Since you are regularly engaged in sexual activity and do not want to continue with oral contraceptive pills, please adopt some other reliable contraceptive method like condom or intrauterine device. I hope this clarifies the issue. ',\n",

There is no role of antibiotic in this. Instead, you should take intestinal digestive enzyme supplementation.2) Elevated SGPT level indicate either liver function is weak or liver has too much load to work. Fatty liver is condition in which excessive fat get deposited in liver tissue and affect liver function. This is the reason for elevated SGPT level in your case.3) Fatty liver is due to high level of fat in blood stream secondary to lipid (fat)-rich diet. This might lead to elevated cholesterol level. Thus, it is recommended for you to undergo lipid profile test.4) Mild fatty liver is reversible condition. You should do - regular exercise, intermittent fasting (weekly once), high protein diet, low fat-diet, use of omega-3 fatty acid containing oil in food preparation, avoidance of alcohol intake.

Usually, wisdom teetChatDoctore in mouth at the age of 18 to 25 years. However, as you have never had them in mouth, it is possible that they might be impacted or locked in the jaw. As right side of jaw is causing you pain, let us focus on that only. Due to absence of physical space to come out in mouth or due to its improper position, it might be possible that the wisdom tooth of that side was locked in the jaw all this time and now might be impinging on the muscle of the mastication or nerve that supplies tongue causing you the pain and discomfort you are experiencing. It is also a possibility that a tooth might be decayed on the side of the jaw that is causing you problems, has developed an abscess that is causing these symptoms.

Now, in many cases people are not able to change jobs or circumstances are such that they have to remain in such conditions.

How are the lesions-itchy / fluid filled / pus filled? It was helpful if you can send us a picture. In hot and humid climate, most likely this is Emilia- small pimples over the skin due to clogging and blockage of sweat glands. In absence of secondary infection (painful / edematous / pus filled), this does not require any specific treatment other than avoiding direct sunlight and keeping the skin cool with wet moping 3-4 times a day(apart from routine bath). If itchy, I used to give calamine lotion and antihistamine like levocetirizine for few days. In short, if she is not febrile and the lesions are not with surrounding edema / pain / tenderness / pus filled-this does not indicate bacterial infection-hence no need of antibiotics and no chance of blood contamination. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. ',\n",

If your partner has a 26-day cycle, it means she would be due around the 18th. A delay does not always mean a pregnancy, it can also be due to the mental anxiety, illness etc. She can test for a pregnancy using a home pregnancy kit about 4-5 days after the date of the missed period (assuming she has regular cycles). Ask her to use a morning sample preferably. If there is a doubt, better do a pelvic ultrasound the week after. Do not worry, seek a gynecologist opinion in case it is positive. All the best.',\n",

Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. What your kid is having is not a diarrhea and is only a gastronomic reflux. It is quite common for kids to pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated. When the kid takes feeds, the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastronomic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

Masturbation i not sin or is dangerous. Masturbation cannot make you sick or unhealthy. It is natural and even animals do it.

Both Tenor and Movie contain equal amounts of Ethinodiol acetate and Ethanol estradiol. The acceptability of oral contraceptive preparations in various individuals differ from each other. Therapeutically both preparations are found to be equally effective. According to surveys conducted, the order of side effects reported by people using Tenor 35 is nausea, bloating, anxiety, breast pain and depression whereas for Movie 35 the order is depression, anxiety, bloating, dizziness and breast pain. Since both are hormonal preparations, these side effects are expected. The symptoms of depression you have, is suggestive of movie.

              " '<human>: Isn t it true that sharp pain in one s right shoulder could indicate parasites in the small and/or large intestines (i.e. amoebic dysentery) which could be seen by the host (amoebic cysts and trophozoites...all stages of development) in one s stool, cause bloating, gas, stomach distention, terrible abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation and progressively get worse if not treated with the appropriate antibiotics and eventually cause the death of the host? Fact or Fiction: Amoebic dysentery has been eradicated in North America. Amoeba and trophozoites cannot be seen by the naked eye. Amoeba generally float on top of the toilet water, easily visible. Standard O&P lab tests cannot detect amoebas and trophozoites. The infected stool must be submitted to a lab that has the special equipment and appropriately trained personnel in order to detect amoebic dysentery disease. Two or more antibiotics will be necessary to eliminate such parasites; long term if the host has been infected over a long period of time. Thank you, Edward DeBusman\\n<bot>: Hi, There is no direct relationship between intestinal infection and shoulder pain. Reasons for both are entirely different. The intestinal infection will lead to diarrhea, bloating and indigestion but not shoulder pain. Reason for shoulder pain may be muscular pain or joint abnormalities. A detailed clinical examination is needed to assess the cause of shoulder pain. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. ',\n",

All other symptoms like nausea & vomiting, frequent urination and the breast symptoms like engorgement with tenderness, dark discoloration of nipples & areola with widening of areola and secretions through nipples appear subsequently, usually 10 to 15 days after missed period. Though you had some vague symptoms, ultimately you have got your menses. Probably after having the menses, the symptoms also might have vanished. When in doubt, urine examination for pregnancy gives clue. That also is negative in your case. So Madam, no missed period and pregnancy test negatives confirms that you are not pregnant. ',\n",

It could really be a hematoma. However, it could be very interesting and informative doing an ultrasound. This would give an idea of the echo structure and borders of the mass. This is important because if there is an associated cyst, it would be important that it should be removed. A possible infection of this mass of hematoma must be considered.

Metanx is a medical food made that contains L-methylfolate (vitamin B9), methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) and pyridoxine 5-phosphate (vitamin B6). It is a vitamin B supplement.

I have not urinated blood Improvement in past 2 weeks seems minimal Please advise\\n<bot>: Hello, Thank you for writing to Chat Doctor about your query, Brief Answer -Treatment for lower back pain depends upon the patients history and the type and severity of pain, as you described I explained below meditation. Explained Answer -The vast majority of lower back pain cases get better within six weeks without surgery, and lower back pain exercises are almost always part of a treatment plan. If pain persists or worsens, more involved diagnostic and surgical procedures may be recommended.  Medications : A wide variety of over-the-counter and prescription medications is available to help reduce symptoms of lower back pain. Many medications reduce inflammation, which is often a cause of pain, while others work to inhibit the transmission of pain signals from reaching the brain. Each medication has multiple unique risks, possible side effects and Chat Doctor. Also, I would suggest Rest for some time more because Ceasing activity for a few days allows injured tissue and even nerve roots to begin to heal, which in turn will help relieve lower back pain. However, more than a few days of rest can lead to a weakening of the muscles, and weak muscles have to struggle to adequately support the spine. Patients who do not regularly exercise to build strength and flexibility are more likely to experience recurrent or prolonged lower back pain. Hope You will find it out helpful. Thanks And ',\n",

When the doctor performed the laparoscopy, I would think that they would have done a test at the same time to see if the fallopian tubes were all right or not. If the doctor said that the tubes were patent(that is, not blocked), there is good chance of your getting pregnant. If your periods are regular, and you have monthly cycles, it would mean that you are ovulating, and that would mean a good chance of pregnancy as well. However, if you don't get pregnant in the next one year, do go back and see a gynecologist with interest in fertility.

I have gone through your description. Since he has two blocks in the heart arteries, and he is advice bypass, the right choice is to go ahead with bypass surgery. I don't know any therapy named KELLEY, but I suppose you are talking about ch elation therapy. This therapy is of no benefit for the patient. The blocks in the heart artery are embedded inside the heart vessel and any amount of medication or therapy cannot decrease it to make it vanish. Medications can only help to stop progression of the block. Definitive way to treat critical heart blockages is an angioplasty or bypass surgery. Had you been my patient my advice would be to go ahead with bypass? Bypass surgery requires a stay of 7- 10 days approx in the hospital. Patient can start walking usually by day 5 after surgery. It requires a recovery period of 20 -25 days, but the long term results of bypass are very good with patients having a good quality of life. Gastric ulcers can be treated with long term antacids.

In the past few days, I have done nothing that might cause these. It s happened a few times in the past, but not often. A few days ago, I started having a sore throat and I was wondering if there could be any corrolation. I cannot remember if the last time this happened was during a time at which I had a sore throat. So far, no unexplained bruising has occured on my stomach, back, chest , etc and very rarely on my arms (though I assume that it s only unexplained because I don t remember hitting something). However, the bruises which have just appeared are not in any place I would bump into. I m a 21 year old otherwise healthy female. The only concering aspect of my medical history is that my mother, my half-sister, and my grandfather on my father s side have all died from cancer . Two cases of melanoma and one of colon cancer. Could the bruising be a result of my sore throat? Or should I be seeing a doctor?\\n<bot>: Hi!welcome to Chat Doctor!SPONTANEOUS BRUISES point towards some bleeding disorder, coagulation defect or thrombocytopenia that is reduced platelet count. Certain viral infections that cause sore throat may also cause platelet to fall resulting in spontaneous bleeding.

My LMP was 22 October, I did my first pregnancy test on 26th December, strong positive, did another one one new years eve with a clearblue test and it said 1-2 weeks pregnant and said to add 2 weeks on for how doctor would date it. Did yet another test due to no symptoms on 14th January which said 3+ weeks and again to add 2 weeks for doctors dates. I paid for a private scan on the 21st January and they believed by the size it was only 5 weeks 3 days, 10days on and still no crmaping,no bleeding and no symptoms?\\n<bot>: Hello, and I hope I can help you today. There are two possibilities of what could be going on with your pregnancy. If you really did conceive back in October, your pregnancy should be about 12 weeks. This would have been found on the ultrasound examination that you had, but instead the fetus measured only five weeks three days. At five weeks it is not normal to see fetal heartbeat so that is not used in the consideration to make a diagnosis. However, it is possible that you conceived later in the cycle after your. In October. If you actually conceived in late November early December it is still possible that the fetus could be viable and that is just younger than it should be by your dates. So the way to tell the difference would be to get another ultrasound examination and approximately two weeks; by then you should see some evidence of the fetal heartbeat if the pregnancy is normal. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of women do not have pregnancy symptoms. The most reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual cycle. Furthermore, judging the number of weeks of pregnancy on a urine tests is extremely inaccurate. Pregnancy tests are designed to pick up the hormone Chat Doctor from that whicChatDoctores out in your urine. However, your urine can be diluted by different amounts of water depending upon what time in the day you tested and how much water you Chat Doctor.  Most urine pregnancy tests ask that you use your first morning urine, which has the most concentrated sample, however, even within those restrictions there is a large margin of error. So I would advise, in your situation, that you repeat the ultrasound examination in another 2 to 3 weeks. In the meantime take good care of yourself for the pregnancy by: eating a well-balanced diet, ',\n",

I have also looked into an umbilical hernia but I am a bit skeptical, and I am not sure it is appendicitis.\\n<bot>: Hello, Appendicitis is a high probability. The pain in appendicitis begins in the per umbilical region(that is around the naval) and then migrates to an area called as McBirney point that is at the junction of the medial 2/3rd and lateral 1/3rd of a line joining your naval with the anterior superior William spine. This area is roughly the same as you have mentioned. Further evaluation is needed. Blood counts, urine examination and ultrasound scan of the abdomen are required. In appendicitis the blood counts will be high, urine will be normal or show mild hematuria and USG abdomen will show an elongated or enlarged appendix. Treatment is mainly surgical, however in some rare mild cases, medical management with painkillers and antibiotics may be tried.',\n",

The uptake seen at L4 - L5 with hypertrophic facet changes are indicative of degeneration because of aging. Such changes occur with age and can cause mild lower back pain and spasm of muscles.

However, as you are very concerned, it will help you to get an ECG done, and blood pressure checked. Once these turn to be normal, I think you must meet a psychiatrist and get a detailed evaluation done. Only After listening yo your problem and your current status one can decide the line of management. I have seen that such ceases respond greatly to paroxetine in a dose of 12.5 to 37.5 mg daily.  The doctor may ask you for therapy, which I think will give additional benefit and help you control some part of anxiety and stress. Hope the reply is helpful feel free to ask more questions Chat Doctor. ',\n",
              " \"<human>: hi,,,,,i am 32 years old woman....trying to conceive from last 1 year.....got the follicular study done couple of times and was found ok....now my doc has referred me for iui....please let me know what could be the reason for not conceiving after every thing being normal.... my hsg test was also normal..\\n<bot>: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I am Chat Doctor. I will be answering your concerns. Among couples trying for pregnancy, 80% of them conceive in the first year and 90% by the end of second year. So don't be worried. You will conceive. Since your doctor has already started treatment I presume that all baseline infertility investigations including semen analysis are normal. Then this is called as unexplained infertility. The cause cannot be found with available investigations. What your doctor has done is right step. Have GUI after induction of ovulation with Gonadotrophin. You can have 3-4 cycles of GUI. I hope and pray you conceive with the help of GUI. If you do not get pregnant with this treatment, the next option would be IVF (in vitro fertilization). I hope this is helpful. If you have further concerns, do contact me through Chat Doctor. To increase your chances of conception maintain normal BMI, quit smoking (if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week. I hope this is helpful. If you have any further concerns do contact me through Chat Doctor.\",\n",

Her doctors gave her clearance for the surgery but I m afraid she won t heal well. will this surgery possibly cause her to relapse with cancer due to stress on her body?\\n<bot>: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should not worry about relapse. Partial hip replacement is done under spinal anesthesia and stress level and risk both are less than general anesthesia. And doctors have declared her fit for surgery means she is able to cope up with the surgical stress. So no need to worry about relapse. Get done surgery.

The cut-off for normal sperm count is at least 20 million/ sperm motility is less than the normal range. Non-motile sperms are 83 %. Normally at least 50 % sperms should have rapid progressive forward motion. There is no comment on morphology and presence/ absence of pus cells, RBC's and other nucleated cells. On the basis of this report your sample is deficient in adequate volume and adequate volume. It can lead to infertility i.e. inability to fertilize an egg under physiological conditions. However, I recommend you to get semen analysis repeated after three days of abstinence. If, again the sperm count remains low, there are other techniques for fertilization of the ovum. You can get details of which from a fertility expert. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor. \",\n",

Welcome to Chat Doctor, You are presuming a big ailment for no obvious reason at all. The common symptoms of Hodgkin's disease are generalized lymph node enlargement, may be weight loss and hepatosplenomegaly. It has to be proved by special tests like immunohistochemistry on biopsy samples. Itching is totally unrelated to this. If you had homeostasis causing itching, it would have been detected by ultrasound. It would be helpful to have a gastroenterologist work up with endoscopy if the pain is too much and tests like those for typhoid etc. Take care.\",\n",

              " '<human>: Hi, I have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease since about age 15, I am now 48 years old. My lumbar all the way down through sacral has been fused. I have constant pain in right foot/toes that I have been able to control for about 7 to 8 years, but now pain is getting worse in back above fusion and in the front below belly button. I am wondering if I may now have an issue at T-12 ? I am a male if that makes any difference.\\n<bot>: Hi, Thanks for writing in. The spine is made up of an alignment of small bones. These bones have sponge like discs between them and the spinal cord passes along the back of these bones through the spinal canal. There might be pressure on the discs in the dorsal and lumbar spine and this is causing slight pressure on the spinal canal at a particular level and causing pinching of nerve roots leading to severe pain in the area supplied by the nerve. The disc problem which had involved the T 12 - L 1 disc might have affected the discs at other levels also. Besides, you also have fused vertebrae at lumbar levels. As your symptoms are on the right it is possible that the nerve roots on the right side are affected. You require to be examined a neurologist and an MRI of the dorsal and lumbar spine if indicated to know if the nerve are under pressure and the location. There are patients who get relief by doing physiotherapy and taking neurogenic pain relievers. Injections are also given for relief. However, this might not always happen. If your pain is severe and not responding to medical treatment then the disc protrusion needs to be removed by doing a small surgery at the cervical neck region. Presently, laser assisted surgical techniques are also available. If the pain is mild then it appears to be a minor problem that is treatable. Please do not worry.',\n",

Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. These symptoms and signs are suggestive of STD especially if there is associated pain, fever, urethral discharge and recent sexual intercourse. So this is the first thing to rule out by doing STD testing. Second, it may be signed of reinfection o urinary stones and some other genital infection, but this is less common.

Scientific studies show that when clinic composite (containing albuterol) is given together with item (containing ipratropium bromide), the results are better compared to clinic composite alone. Therefore, you can give both preparations together, 2-4 times a day because they will not harm your baby but at the contrary, will help him.

Some tests are needed to investigate for the possible underlying causes: - a brain CT scan-complete blood count for anemia-fasting glucose and HbA1C levels-blood electrolytes- kidney and liver function tests.

              " \"<human>: I have been dealing with kidney stones since 1979. Recently I was in the emergency for pain from a kidney stone blockage. The ER doc ordered a CT scan to confirm the stone. When the results came back he informed me that I had stones in my liver and my spleen . My questions are: What causes spleen and liver stones; and is any treatment advised?\\n<bot>: Hi Linda, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Since you have stones in the kidney, liver and spleen, you will need to do thyroid function tests to rule out hypercalcinosis, which is a condition in which there is above normal levels of calcium in the blood, which can lead to stone formation in various organs. If hypercalcinosis is detected, then it will need to be treated. Liver and spleen stones don't need to be treated. If there are stones in the Gall Bladder and if they are causing problem, then surgical removal of gall bladder is required.  Wish you all the best.\",\n",

Now i feel that my abdomen are large size and tight after food but i have no any symtom like no fever, no pain, no lose wts. I dought for again abdomen TB.\\n<bot>: Hi. Thanks for your query. Read your history and understood the problem. It is good that you had been diagnosed and well treated for Tuberculosis of abdomen. Since you were asymptomatic for last year the chances of an active TB of abdomen is remote. The probable causes for belatedness and tightness of your abdomen can be: Intestinal sub-acute intestinal obstruction due to stricture formation of intestine; this is quite common sequel. Can be a mild gastroenteritis. I would advise you the following. X-ray of the abdomen in standing position. This is the cheapest and simplest test to see for intestinal obstruction. Ultrasonography and CT scan of the abdomen to confirm. Routine tests of blood and urine. Enterocolitis if obstruction is suspected, Diagnostic Laparoscopy: this helps in diagnosis and well as therapeutically. One can cut the bands / release the adhesions. Take a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole for 5 days, is there is a response, nothing to worry. - Maintain healthy food habits, avoid too many fibrous foods as they can cause repeated sub-acute intestinal obstructions. If no relief further investigations and treatment will be required.',\n",

Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks. Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.

              " '<human>: My baby is of two weeks. First week breast feeding was good enough for him however from last couple of days it has reduced a lot. Hence we started feeding lactogen but he vomits it out very frequently. What we are supposed to do to ensure he is being feed properly?\\n<bot>: Thanks for posting on Chat Doctor. Breast milk is the best possible food for a baby and there can be no alternatives for that. Lactose or any other formula, is cow milk based and difficult to digest for the baby. So, in such a condition, the baby often vomits it out. Try not to go for formula feeds and go for breastfeeding as far as you can. You may express your breast milk and store it in a refrigerator before you bring it to the normal temperature and give to the baby. In case of breastfeeding, insert the entire nipple along with the areola (not only the nipple) in the babies mouth. Feed one breast at a time and alternate breasts with each feed. Breast milk is produced as per the demands of the baby as express through the suckling. In case of formula feeding, the hunger of the baby is reduced, and the baby suckles less automatically reducing the amount of breast milk produced. So, reduce formula feeds as far as you can. The adequacy of the feeds would be expressed with the amount of urine passed. Passing urine at least 5-6 times in 24 hours is to be considered adequate. Hope that helps. Feel free to revert with further queries if any.',\n",

The possibilities based from just your description are varied. Most common causes of lung cancer are history of smoking, occupational exposure to chemicals or inhalation agents that could be deposited in lungs, hereditary.

Some breast cancers are made to grow faster by a natural hormone called estrogen. Anastrozole decreases the amount of estrogen the body makes and helps to slow or reverse the growth of these breast cancers. Hot flashes, headache, trouble sleeping, dizziness, stomach upset, nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight gain, tiredness/weakness, increased coughing, or sore throat may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly. Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: heart disease (such as history of heart attack), bone loss (osteoporosis), liver disease, high blood pressure, blood clots. I will advise you to take one anastrozole tablet per day for 5 years. Its side effects can be managed symptomatically, Regards',\n",

Low potassium can increase blood pressure, however, it is usually not the sole reason. You need to be on antihypertensives with consultation from your doctor.2. Taking potassium tablets is risky. Cardiovascular effects, particularly arrhythmia are dangerous. 3. You can concentrate on improving potassium by improving diet by including items like banana, green leafy vegetables, potatoes, fish, yogurt, mushrooms, etc. Improving potassium will reduce risk of high blood pressure, stroke and cardiovascular disease.

I have gone through your query and would like to offer my opinion. The efficacy rate of an emergency contraceptive pill depends on the time delay after the intercourse before the pill is used.

Delayed positive test could be due to exceptional additional delayed ovulation from the other ovary. In such confusion, I would advise you to take the help of ultrasonography. Ultrasonographic ovulation monitoring has an edge over the kit:1. It gives visual evidence of ovulation.2. It informs us about the size of the follicle when it ruptured to release egg. Follicles between 18 mm to 21 mm size give best results of pregnancy. 3. It informs about the endometrial thickness also. For successful implantation, at least 10 mm thick endometrium is lucrative.

In patients undergoing dialysis and having stopped there could be multiple reasons for bleeding.

In your case serum bilirubin level is normal so need not worry. The aminotransferase is sensitive indicators of LIVER CELL INJURY and are most helpful in recognizing acute hepatocellular disease such as HEPATITIS.

Sgot is found in liver, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, brain, pancreas, lungs, leukocytes, and erythrocytes in DECREASING disorder of concentration. Sgpt is mainly found in the liver. I want to explain to you that any mild disease or any injury to above-mentioned organs may be responsible for high level of GOT. While primarily Sept is in liver, so any cell injury to liver cells may be responsible for liver disease. But this level is not so high so at present need not worry, if you didn't have any other symptoms. Keep regular watch over liver function tests and symptoms. Besides avoid wine, Chat Doctor. Still if you have any doubt get in MRI and ultrasound of liver. Consult a physician and get his opinion as physical examination is also important. Good luck.\",\n",

If you had this unprotected sex act in the fertile period of her cycle then she should take emergency contraceptive pills within 72 hours of unprotected sex act. As you might be aware that pre ejaculation fluid contains sperms enough to cause pregnancy. And it gets deposited without you noticing it. So even if you pull out before ejaculation, it is not a safe sex. It is not due to washed hands but due to pull out method, she stands chance to get pregnant. I hope this answer helps you.

I am Chat Doctor. The swelling you have in the ankles, feet and around the eyelids is not related to the stomach ulcers or the medications you take. Swelling like these occurs due to either heart, liver or kidney diseases. Puffiness around the eyes usually occurs in kidney disease.

She just checked her blood pressure and it is normal and her pulse rate is 72. Could she still have a heart attack with normal blood pressure and pulse rate? Thanks, Kelli\\n<bot>: Hi, Lightheadedness associated with palpitations can be caused by irregularities in heart rhythm.  Heart rate and blood pressure can be normal in these cases, but it is important to know what her heart rhythm is, and what is usually done is an ECG which documents the electrical activity of the heart. It may not be a \"heart attack\" per se, but it is noteworthy that she may undergo tests as part of the work-up.  And I would suggest a consult with a doctor to be able to check other causes of dizziness such as a musculoskeletal problem in the neck, as well as problems in the eyes and ears which may cause dizziness, apart from a problem in the heart.

First thing is you cannot wear a denture which is bigger than the size of our palate. Definitely you will have a gag reflex as the over extension of the denture is into the soft palate area leading to gag reflexes. Coming to the growth part, you are already 38yrs old, at this age there won't be any growth in your body parts. Only thing what can be done is asked your dentist to prepare another set of dentures which are of your size not huge and size of the teeth should be reduced, and your occlusion should be checked thoroughly and extensions of the dentures are important so that you won't end up in gag reflexes anymore. Best thing is to see a prosthodontist. Hope this information will help you. Take care.\",\n",

I am on blood pressure medication and one half of a water pill plus baby aspirin .This is because I only have one functioning kidney due to chemo damage to my left kidney\\n<bot>: Hi, Please get the renal function tests done and if it is normal you need not worry about having single kidney. Usually the remaining kidney compensate for the other non-functioning kidney. The bruise might be because of aspirin. However you have to consult your physician for definitive diagnosis. Take care not to take too many analgesics without prescription as they will have adverse effect on kidneys. Regularly monitor your kidney function. Regards',\n",
              " '<human>: :) hey i got a question .. so yeah i had a root canal on one tooth and  being lazy i forgot to get the permanent filling and as time passed my tooth fell out .. so my question is .. Can i still get infection there even if i had a root canal and forgot to get the filling and my tooth fell out ??\\n<bot>: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The chances of root canal treated tooth getting infected is very less unless it is not properly treated. The fell out tooth structure could be only the crown portion. The Root canal treated tooth becomes weak after RCT, so it has to be crowned immediately. Now the roots might be remaining with in the bone. Consult an oral physician and get a radiograph to rule out the presence of root piece. If root is there then get it removed. I hope my answer will help you, take care.',\n",

If she is really allergic to milk, taking any milk product (be it curd, buttermilk, butter, milk biscuits, milk chocolates, etc.) can cause her allergic reactions.2. If she is not taking any milk products and still she develops allergic reactions, I would suggest allergy testing for other foods such as soy, ground nut, wheat, rice, egg, seafoods, tree nuts, etc. This will help you to identify the allergy, if any.3. Hives can occur even without allergies. Possible causes are viral infections, bacterial infections, parasites, Chat Doctor. 4.

Since you are diabetic, this kind of purulent infection can be seen with mixed infection like aerobic, anaerobic bacteria with tuberculosis.

Just to recapitulate: dull tightness in right abdomen - full after eating small meals - balled up in one area-gassy- being pulled because of how tight it is.-everything except for a CT or MRI- I would advise starting with a simple investigation like: Plain X-ray of the whole abdomen in the standing position-this may show air-fluid shadow if intestinal obstruction. Yes, CT will definitely help the diagnosis. In the meantime he should stop all the foods and beverages that you both have observed to have increased the problem.

In the worst case scenario this can be a gangrenous situation setting it. Assuming you are young and healthy that should not be the case. If your nails are too long they can bang into the front of your shoe causing a separation of the nail from the nail bed or bleeding under the nail which causes pressure and pain. If there is blood under the nail the blood would need to be released to relieve the pain. Another cause of a ring on the toe is ringworm which is a fungal infection-though, that is usually not severely painful as you describe\",\n",

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain and give you my opinion. We talk about hypertension if we have mean values that exceeds 140/90 mmHg. Hypertension is divided in two groups: essential or idiopathic hypertension without an identifiable cause and secondary hypertension, usually in young ages, meaning that is a secondary cause of it. This cause might be a renal disease, an endocrine problem, a cardiovascular pathology. As you explain, you have done all the examinations, and they result normal. According to this, we are dealing with essential hypertension. It is a chronic disease. It has not a definite cure, but it should be treated life long. If you tell that you still have high blood pressure values despite your treatment, it means that you have to rise your medication to better control your blood pressure. So, if I was your treating doctor I will recommend a holder pressure monitoring for 24 h, to know your mean values. After that if they result high I will add another medicament or rise the dosage of your existing ones. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards.',\n",

Each month my CBC values have been declining. My question is : Will I need a transfusion if I postpone getting my fibriods removed?\\n<bot>: Based on your query my opinion is1. Yes, fibroid can cause a fall in hemoglobin values and parameters related to RBC.2. This is explained by the effect of sub mucosal fibroid which can cause increased bleeding, so blood loss results in decrease RBC counts and Hemoglobin.3. You need to get it removed if it is a large fibroid and sub mucosal in location.4. Transfusion requirements depend on how much your Hemoglobin is. If it's less than 7, you will require transfusion, if not it can be corrected by parenteral iron therapy. Hope this helpsRegards\",\n",

Before, my went to the doctor she was recommended to go to the dermatologist. When she went there, they just gave her creams and some anti-inflammatory lotions which doesn t work on her. Then after that, she went to another doctor (it was her co-worker, my mom worked in a hospital as a Nursing Attendant btw) so she asked her co-worker if she could do a biopsy on her leg. But the doctor said she couldn t, not unless she undergo MRI testing first to know which part should she do the procedure. So a week after that, my mom went to the other hospital (this hospital is private and a well known hospital in our town) so after a week, she got the result. They told her that it was only a thickening of the leg muscles and that her veins on her leg (right) are kinda loose so she needs to support it, so they advised her to buy their product to support her veins. It s like a stocking but it s thicker than a normal stocking and which is really tight on her. The doctor said that she should wear it on the day time coz and remove it during the night time to let her leg breathe. But, nothing happened. The more she wear that stocking, the more that bruise on her leg turns dark. And btw, that pain she s feeling started as a small lump then over the period of time turns what it is now. So please do help me, because I really love my mom and seeing her like that pains me. Thank you!\\n<bot>: Hello, Dark bruise on the leg with chronic pain is commonly due to Thrombocytopenia (Idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura / Heparin induced thrombocytopenia). She can take Acetaminophen (Tylenol), one SOS when required for relieve from pain. She can apply ointment Thrombophob or Thrombophob gel locally on the area affected to reduce the dark bruise. However, other medical conditions that may cause similar symptoms are Superficial thrombophlebitis (inflammation / swelling of a vein due to a blood clot), Hematoma, Deep vein thrombosis, varicose vein complications, etc. You are suggested to visit ER, get your mother clinically examined by a GP, get Blood & Imaging tests done at the earliest.

The history of burst of the lump and giving bitter fluid in mouth may be due to the swelling and infection of the submandibular salivary gland. The causes cane : stone in the duct of the gland or a stricture in the duct or infection and inflammation of the gland. I would advise having a clinical examination by the Surgeon or the ENT Surgeon by putting a gloved finger and palpate for the stone and the gland. If there is an impacted stone in the ducts, this can be easily removed and a few stitches to invert the opening so that the complication is reduced. If there is a gland infection with the swelling and stones, this may have to be removed.',\n",

When the child is unable to digest it, the undigested remains are degraded by intestinal bacteria to produce foul smelling gases.

I work for a naturopath, but his specialty is not chemo or radiation, but would like someone who will work with him in my care.\\n<bot>: Hi, Thanks for writing in. Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and treatment differs in every patient depending on the location, size, staging and post surgery biopsy findings. Since you have had surgery only 9 days ago, it will help to discuss with your oncologist and depending on the biopsy report, go for a comprehensive treatment. Even is the margins are clear, there is estrogen/ progesterone positive nature and this requires you to have chemotherapy and radiation. The earliest this is started the best outcome it will have. I wish you reconsider the benefits of chemotherapy and radiation in your case and start treatment on time. Naturopathy can give you comfort and detoxify your system, and it is best to discuss your treating doctor on when to take simple naturopathy procedures and wait until you are done with initial chemotherapy. Even if the margins are clear, there can still be persisting microscopic invasion of cells and this can lead to flaring of cancer an few months.

              " '<human>: Hi, I am 36 weeks pregnant. All my reports have been fine considering baby weight, amniotic fluid & doppler flow. However, my last ultrasound a couple of days ago showed the baby in a head up position with a single loop of cord around neck. Can I still have a normal delivery? can the baby turn on its own in due course of time to engage in head down position, before my delivery date which is 14th Feb.?\\n<bot>: Hello, and I hope I can help you today. If your baby is in the head up position at term, it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally, because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. So if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position, your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section. However, there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. Ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. Going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air, like an angry cat, for 10 minutes every day, can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally. However, the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. In the US, versions, which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. It works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery. Regarding the cord around the babies neck, 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. So the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position. If you are considering having a version, I suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon, as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks. I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and this information was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery,',\n",

Secondly can someone grow up with hepatitise B from child hood up to the age of 60s? if so what is the life span of the person having a chronic HIV B?\\n<bot>: If you have elevated liver enzymes and hepatitis B you should probably get treatment, but it also depends on the results of your liver biopsy (if there is active inflammation or not). Also getting treated will prevent your chances of getting liver cancer. If you are coinfected with HIV, then you should definitely control the hepatitis B with medications since the risk of liver cancer is higher if you have both HIV and hepatitis B. Keep in mind that some HIV medications also work against Hepatitis B (such as tenofovir, also known as Arvada) reasons why your doctor may have stopped lamivudine.',\n",

There are different reasons for infertility. It can be due to male or female causes or due to a combination. In terms of your partner, you are right in assuming that he would need a semen analysis. The cost would vary according to one lab to the next. He can either consider speaking to his urologist, speaking to a lab directly to find out the cost. In terms of your investigations, your doctor would need to assess the different aspect of the reproductive system-the uterus, ovaries, tubes, cervixThis would involve both imaging and blood tests. You should consider visiting your gynecologist or a fertility specialist. Even if issues are found with either of you there are effective techniques available that may be able to help you conceive.

Is this unusual? I thought crowns were permanent.  Should I get a second opinion, and how do I go about doing that??\\n<bot>: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it is possible that if the margins of the crown is not intact and there is a gap between crown and tooth, water and food debris along with bacteria can seep into the tooth and leads to secondary Infection. In this case if the decay has not reached the nerves present in the center of tooth then you may not have pain, but the tooth can continue to decay. If this is the case you will have to get the crown removal, get the tooth filled or Root Canal treatment has to be done followed by replacing the crown. You can take a second opinion if you wish as well as you can send me a scan of the x Ray of the crowned tooth so that I can guide you how you should proceed for treatments. In case if tooth is decayed then the treatment advised to you is appropriate. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. ',\n",

It has some side effects like fungal infections of mouth and throat (Candidiasis). Systemic steroid effects on higher doses like mood changes, hyperglycemia, smell & taste disturbances, osteoporosis etc. Your son has been prescribed Decor two puffs of 200 micrograms twice daily that means a total of 800 micrograms which equals to 0.8 mg only. Moreover, very little amount of steroid is absorbed as it is used via inhalation.Therefore, its side effect is almost negligible except candidiasis. That is why your child is advised to gurgle his mouth with plain water after taking puffs which will prevent candidiasis.

However, you need not worry about it as till now you haven't done a TMT, and the last was good according to the information provided . Even if your TMT comes positive there are still 30% change that the report is false positive.  So don't take unnecessary stress of the future. Hoping I could help. Regards Chat Doctor. \",\n",

When you are a diagnosed case of an ovarian cyst, this becomes the most probable reason in spite of the fact that you have pain on the right side of the abdomen and the ovarian cyst is on the left ovary. Other reasons of pain in right side like appendicitis, colitis, nephritis, lymph node mass, salpingitis and ovarian problem can be diagnosed on ultrasonography and be confirmed with CT scan. Once the probable diagnosis is made you can go for a diagnostic Laparoscopy and undergo definite surgery if need be, You can ask for the tumor marker tests since you have a history of cancer in the family.',\n",

As per your complaint bleeding from airhole can be due to infection in the area of ear-piercing while at times tightly packed earrings can lead to lack of air flow to the area of ear-piercing and can lead to inflammation and slight area of necrosis. I would suggest you to avoid wearing the earrings for a few days and clean the area with antiseptic solution and apply an antibiotic ointment over it. Cool compresses can also be relieving. You should wear earrings a bit loosely fastened so that air can flow easily. You should also wear gold or plastic earrings as they are inert materials and will not cause allergic reaction.

He has been depressed before all this happened and won t tell his parents why. Are the voices and attempted suicide from the accident alone?\\n<bot>: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your question... Since you say that he had been depressed even before the accident, it is more likely that his current psychiatric symptoms are related to the depression. When depression becomes severe, psychotic symptoms can appear (like hearing voices, false beliefs, etc.) Moreover, since he was well enough to be sent home after the accident, it is unlikely that he would have suffered from any significant brain damage.  Depression can be caused due to neurochemical imbalances in the brain and need not be stress related always. So, it is not surprising that he did not reveal anything to his parents. With appropriate medication and close follow up he should be able to come out of his depression. Best wishes,- ',\n",

Every cancer patient is different and accurate staging is to be done before giving treatment. Tata memorial hospital Mumbai is a research center, and they might have accurately done staging for your uncle. I guess the doctors want to shrink the tumor with chemotherapy and then proceed with surgery. The benefit in this situation is that the surgery is easy and there are better chances of survival. In many cancer hospitals the same protocol is used, and you might take another opinion at any well known cancer center. There is Kiddie memorial institute of oncology in Bangalore and cancer research center in Chennai and driven Chat Doctor.  Your uncle might take opinions at these centers before going for surgery. There is no single best doctor when we consider cancer treatment. It is an evolving field of medicine and I refer my patients to Tata memorial hospital because their set-up is organized and regularly new treatment options are reviewed for research purposes.

Raynauds disease is an autoimmune disease and is treated with steroids. The disease runs a chronic course with waxing and waning course. Steroids have to be taken as the disease flares up or relapses. Episodes have to be controlled with Chat Doctor. The effect of herbal medications is questionable.

Should i go have it looked at now or wait.\\n<bot>: Hello, Thanks for your query. I am happy to help you here. Today is 22nd of July. If you have swelling till today, then it's better to have a follow-up. Usually snakes are non poisonous. But if snakes are poisonous usually its either cardio toxic or neurotoxic & sometimes both. Swelling doe snot confirms that the snake was toxic, but it needs attention further. Although it's rare that toxin will show its action after 15 days but until the swelling subsides u need to be kept on watch. 4 views of antivenom may not be sufficient if knowledgeable symptoms appear, & if no symptoms appear, you may not need anti venom at all, but for that you should be kept in watch for at least three days. Even if just swelling appears its considered safe to administer antivenom, some patient body react to antivenom and can't be continued further. I don't think you are in trouble of having activation of toxin but still you should keep watch on yourself for following things until the swelling subsides.1) If either or both eyelids starts Chat Doctor. 2) or if you develop numbness (decrease/loss of sensation on touch.) 3)Any kind of unnatural bleeding from nose or in stool etc. If any of above complaints develop then It's must revisit ER.

For now, I suggest you to either have a follow-up or you can take some medications as bellow. Chymoral forte once died before food for 1 wk (it will help to decrease swelling)Tab Exocet 5\\xa0mg 1 at night before sleep for 3 days (to decrease itching)Tab metronidazole 400\\xa0mg thrice daily for 5 days.

For this reason, I recommend performing an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring for possible cardiac arrhythmia and some blood lab tests (complete blood count for anemia, thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction, blood electrolytes for possible imbalance).  Regarding her glucose levels, she may have diabetes. For this reason, I would recommend performing HbA1C levels to check for diabetes. In case it is elevated, consulting with an endocrinologist is necessary.  Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  ',\n",

Thanks for your query. I understand that you are going through a difficult time due to your recent problems. The symptom that you are experiencing now, that is, a fear or a feeling that you may get another panic attack is called anticipatory anxiety and this is common in persons who have had previous panic attacks.

I read your query very carefully. You are having chest discomfort (twinges on your chest) for a few weeks now, which may be a sign for new onset chest angina. New onset angina may be a warning sign for future cardiovascular events including heart attack. This is why its essential that you contact a cardiologist for further examinations.

It really hurts when I am sitting for too long, and I feel discomfort like something is pressuring my abdominal wall. Please help.\\n<bot>: Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the Chat Doctor. As you have already been examined clinically and a thorough imaging was performed, my understanding is you may not have any visceral problem. Your doctors have also ruled out body wall defect like hernia.in some cases, fibromyalgia may produce similar symptoms in the absence of an organic disease. Therefore, you should also consult a psychiatrist to evaluate for fibromyalgia. You should also be clinically examined by a second doctor (should be a general surgeon) to rule out any abnormality.

Based on the facts of your query, you seem to suffer from-Boil with lymphadenitis, with resolved nodes after antibiotics. Remaining lumps indicates Chronic Amenities with fibrotic changes in it. Reason of antibiotics not giving regression of these lumps is due to the accompanied Chronic fur uncle- lumps with its lymphadenitis.FNAC biopsy / or Excision Biopsy / or CT study -of the persistent lumps, would give the exact cause of these persistent/ non-regressive lumps. Other causes like infectious mono, or viral lymphadenitis/or TB lymphadenitis/ NHL/HL lymphoma-needs to be ruled out.

When i finished on the toilet, i noticed that my vagina was swollen (lips etc). I am also pregnant. Do you know why this happened? Please help!\\n<bot>: Hello dear, I understand your concern. In my opinion iron supplements are known to cause constipation or hard stools. Constipation is routinely seen complaint in pregnancy. To prevent the constipation:-1) Change the iron preparation- Certain iron preparations tend to cause gastritis, constipation etc. So changing the brand might be tried.2)Take adequate fluids up to 3 liters per day.3)Take high fiber diet daily.4)Take laxatives if needed. Nothing to worry. It will subside by following the above measures. Coming to vaginal lips swelling check for any infection like white discharge or itching or any high BP. The swelling can also be related to excessive straining at stools. If everything is normal the swelling might be considered physiological as some swelling of vaginal lips might be there in pregnancy and subsides after delivery. But iron preparations might not be associated with swelling of vaginal lips. Anyways nothing to worry as such. Prevention of constipation is important to avoid other problems. Hope this helps.

The measurements give an estimate of weeks but, a variability from the actually calculated date can be present, as ultrasound only gives a rough estimate. So in effect the ultrasound findings can be plus or minus 1 week in first trimester; 2 weeks in second trimester; and more than two weeks in third. This variability is decreased with newer machines but can't be totally removed. So I would say that this report is absolutely reassuring, and you should not worry at all. A good fetal heart rate and a placenta which is only grade 1 maturity indicates that everything is as it should be at this stage. Do not worry. Hope this helps. Regards.\",\n",

It may be due to many reasons like hepatitis, alcohol intake, altered lipid profile, medicines,autoimmune causes etc. You may need few more investigations like routine hologram, complete liver function test, random blood sugar, lipid profile, viral markers, urine RE/ME, ultrasound of abdomen.

              " '<human>: I ve been experiencing bouts of severe abdominal pain over the past 7 months and admitted to the hospital four times. I ve been given different diagnoses of diverticulitis , irritable bowel , typhlitis and colities. The pain initially presented on my right side and also intermittently included back pain. The stomach pain on a scale of 1-10 is usually 7-8. I ve had an ultrasound, a abdominal CT scan with and without contrast, an EGD, a HIDA scan and most recently a colonoscopy and I m scheduled for a CT scan with and without contrast with a pancreatic window. My History: 49 year old African American female, 5 2 , 220lbs (lost 30 pounds in the last 6 months). I currently take cardizem cd 120mg, losartan 50mg, ferrous sulfate 325 twice a day, protonix 40mg, singulair at night and just finished 500mg of levoquin after my last hospital stay July 21-23. I had H Pylori back in 1989, had my gall bladder removed in 2006, had ovarian masses/tumors removed in 2008 along with a complete historectomy. I also have a mass and cysts on my right kidney (which I was informed was perfectly harmless--been there since 2008). My last 2 hospital stays were because of hypertension, heart palpitations, tightness in my chest, headaches, sweats, pains in the left arm, lightheaded/dizziness. Tests showed a normal EKG, but some tachycardia. The EGD showed a hiatal hernia and a growth that was sent out for a biopsy. Lab reports showed among other things, anemia. The ct scan showed typhlitis , whatever that is. The colonoscopy showed stenotic ileocecal valve. The doctors have come to a concensus...they don t know what it is. Here are the majority of the pieces of the puzzle, any light you can shed would be greatly appreciated.\\n<bot>: Hi MEANS, Welcome to Chat Doctor ! Your problem is really very complex. So many possible causes are there. Two of your medicines need to be switched, Singular needs to be stopped you can take other inhalations anti-asthmatic which are equally effective, You are taking excessive doses of iron- I would suggest 100\\xa0mg thrice a day after meals, which is most tolerated dose. You might have post-surgical bands which result in intermittent obstruction and pain, that is more so a case if you are totally well in between the episodes. Another prominent possibilities is tuberculosis of abdomen. If your problem does not get resolved soon please review with your gastro-surgeon, and possibly you would need an exploratory laparotomy for a diagnosis and intraoperative intervention if possible. You need a physical examination by your physician and get baseline investigations like Chest X-Ray, Electrocardiogram, Complete Blood Counts, Renal Function Test, Liver Function Test, Fasting and Postprandial Blood Sugar, Thyroid Profile, Lipid Profile, Ultrasound Abdomen, Urine Compete Examination. This work up is expected to detect the underlying problem, so a definite treatment could be started.  I hope this advice would be helpful for you. Still if you have any queries or doubts, please write me back, I would be happy to solve them. Wish you a great health!',\n",

When I attended clinic I was told I wouldn t need an X-ray as they were certain from my original X-ray that I hadn t broken anything, to take my cast off & get it moving again. I mentioned I had a numbness and pins & needles in my thumb but that was put down to the cast I d had on. One week later, I still have a numbness/pins & needles in my thumb & my wrist continues to ache/throb. Is this normal or do I need to go back & be seen again? I don t want to waste anyone s time.\\n<bot>: Dear patient, a needles and pins sensation is generally due to a nerve compression/irritation. If it wasn't due to the cast (that's a possibility), probably your trauma provoked a hematoma pressing on a nerve (median nerve? Collateral nerve of the thumb? It depends on numbness distribution). I propose to wait a month from the trauma. If this sensation persist, get an electromyography/electroneurography to objective the nerve injury. If positive, do an RMN of wrist and hand to understand the cause (i.e. hematoma) and project its possible removal. Concerning instead your doubt about a scaphoid fracture, I don't know which X-ray projections you did (scaphoid fractures are hard to be seen in standard X-rays). However, if your wrist remained very painful for 10-15 days after the trauma, a scaphoid X-ray projection or, better, a wrist CT, would solve your doubts\",\n",

Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

The itching is still persistent and leads to bump formation, on itching think it is due to bug bite may be right, it could be due to bug bite.

              " '<human>: Hi I m 22 year old I had a implanon for 4 years nd had put a new one in April 2013 nd had it removed on June 5th 2014 what I wanna know is can I fell pregnant straight away nd is their a chance I may have a miscarriage nd I have been also having weird symptoms like my belly seems to feel a bit tight at times seem to be weeing abit nd had a day of just spotting I had unprocected sex with my boyfriend on the weekend before my implanon was removed and all so afterwards\\n<bot>: Hello and I hope I can help you today.First, I want to reassure you that it is not possible that you could have conceived if you had unprotected sex before your Implant was removed. Implanon is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy while it is in place, and it takes time for you to ovulate again (at least 7-10 days) after it is removed. So if you only had unprotected sex immediately before and after your implant was removed, it is unlikely you could have conceived so quickly. Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the same symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy such as nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, headaches and irregular bleeding can also happen from an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. Many women have irregular periods after discontinuing a hormonal birth control method. So, I suggest you wait for your period, which should occur around 4 weeks after your Implant removal, and if you miss your period, a urine pregnancy test will be accurate at this time. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. Best wishes,',\n",

These two are common causes, but other diseases have to be ruled out by history and examination. In my opinion, it is recommended that first a diagnosis is made, and then proper treatment is instituted.

Certainly a year of antibiotics should have taken care of most infections, depending on what antibiotic was used. Unusual infections or internal infections (e.g., abscess in a muscle or organ) might cause a persistent elevated WBC, as might a chronic inflammatory condition. You would probably be having other symptoms, such as persistent fevers, pain, or weight loss, if that were the case. You don't say how high the WBC count is, so it is hard to assess its severity.  Be sure the Cushing disease is well treated first. If you are still having elevated WBC, you might need further evaluation or need to see a hematologist to get a specific diagnosis. Hope this helps.\",\n",

This is a\" diabetic foot\" :Presentation of diabetic foot is of three type :1 Neuropathic foot in which neuropathy dominates .2 The neuroischemic foot, in which occlusive vascular disease is the main factor .3 Non-neuroishemic but purely infected foot. Since you are a diabetic patient, so any of above possibility may be the reason of NON-HEALING DIABETIC FOOT. In my opinion you must consult a PLANETOLOGIST and get his opinion. If color of infected toe is reddish bluish and foul smell is there then you may have developed GANGRENE. So at earliest consult a PLANETOLOGIST and get his opinion. Hope this will help you.',\n",

Thank you for asking at Chat Doctor. I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Although more details would help, from your current symptoms, I would first think of allergy.2. Were I treating you, I would suggest you montelukast and levocetirizine regularly during your \"bad\" season. You can also start montelukast 1 week before onset of \"bad\" season which may reduce your symptoms.3. If still you have cough, I would suggest you to get your chest examined by a doctor who will listen to it with a stethoscope and may identify the cause of cough.4. I would suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances you may be allergic to and also to know the measures to avoid them.5. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.

I got pcod 1 year back i took crimson tablets is there any problem to conceive? Pls reply me thank u.\\n<bot>: Hello dear, i understand your concern. In my opinion there might not be any problem in conceiving if your cycles are regular. The cause for minimal flow like thyroid abnormalities should be ruled out.Also, as you have a history of POD previously an ultrasound might be needed to check for the POD status. First and most important is avoided stress and anxiety related to pregnancy because they cause hormonal imbalance and delay the conception further. If ultrasound and thyroid profile are normal then nothing to worry. Practice regular intercourse to increase the conception chances. Best regards... Chat Doctor. ',\n",

              " '<human>: I am 24 years of age. I had a tumor surgically taken out. After its biopsy it was found to be pure dysgerminoma. The tumor was confined to one overy. It was a conservative surgey. Do i need a chemotherapy? What is the survival rate with and without chemo. 5 year survival rate means the person only has 5 years to live?\\n<bot>: Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to take chemotherapy for dysgerminoma after surgery. Stage 1 requires only surgery because it is immature teratoma. However, higher stage is best treated with chemotherapy. Dysgerminomas are usually very sensitive to chemo, and can sometimes be treated with the less toxic combination of carbonation and topside. Giving chemotherapy will control the disease and prevent recurrence. Recurrence takes place in few patients even after surgery. That is why probably your doctors have recommended chemotherapy. With chemotherapy survival rates are high in the early stages. Almost every patient will respond to treatment. In cancer survival 5 year is considered a benchmark for treatment. If a patient survives for 5 years then their cancer is considered treated. Patients can live for a lifetime. Please do not worry.',\n",

Thanks\\n<bot>: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Sore and itchy nipples are not the signs and symptoms of Sexually Transmitted Infection.

Thoughts?\\n<bot>: HI, thanks for using Chat Doctor It is possible that they are bites that have become infected. Bites can become infected when bacteria are introduced from under the nails during itching. It is not likely that they are linked to the cold that you are currently fighting. The use of topical antibiotics may help but if they do not resolve with topical treatment then oral antibiotics would be needed. You should also consider repellent to prevent further bites.

Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would go for an ultrasound abdomen to rule out any pelvic adnexal disease or a urinary stone disease on the left side. Apart from it, any kind of pelvic infection or an UTI could also give rise to such pain. To rule this out, you have to get yourself examined clinically by a gynecologist, followed by a urine routine/microscopic/culture and sensitivity test and also an ultrasound of the abdomen. Therefore, I would advise you to take appointment with a gynecologist if not done already. Till then, you could go for an antispasmodic Chat Doctor.

I have shoe inserts which leveled my hips and legs. I recently pulled a muscle in my lower back. I have been experiencing lower back pain and stiffness, along with sciatic pain. I have also been experiencing intermittent pain in my left testicle. It comes and goes and sometimes moves to the right testicle. I have also noticed a frequent urge to urinate. I have noticed that not as much urine comes out and I still feel like I have to go shortly thereafter. If I massage the area near the rectum and behind the scrotum, it provides relief. Movement also provides some relief. The pain moves around between the testicles and base of the penis. Sometimes it disappears completely. I have not been tested for an STI, mainly because I have been married for over 5 years and have no other sexual partners. There have also been no physical signs, i.e. discharge, burning/pain while urinating, cloudy or smelly urine, blood in urine/ejaculate, etc. I have had issues with urination for at least 10 years.

Thanks\\n<bot>: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. There are few causes for altered mental status and confusion in lung cancer patients. 1.

Viral infections do not respond to antibiotics and resolve spontaneously in 5-10 days. Management is supportive. Giving Tylenol should reduce the pain and help.

              " '<human>: I have general gum recession on my bottom teeth and slight recession on my upper canines. Im thinking about getting gum grafts to cover the exposed root surfaces. But as Im currently wearing braces, Im not sure what I should do. Should I wait until the orthodontic treatment is over and then get gum grafts? Or is during the orthodontic treatment fine?\\n<bot>: Dear friend. Thanks for sharing your concern. As you are wearing orthodontic braces for teeth alignment, your teeth will take new position due to it root movements.Therefore, it is best to go for gum grafts only after that. Also remember mild recession can itself get corrected after orthodontic braces removal. It is only in severe recession cases you need to get your gums covered with tissues through grafts. That will reduce your teeth sensitivity as well as enhance esthetically. Meanwhile, it is advised to get your teeth cleaned once, upon consulting your orthodontist, because deposition of calculus and stains also leads to gum recession. Maintain very good oral hygiene, and you can use antiseptic mouth rinses too. Hope it helps. Thanks. Take care.',\n",

Can you please give me some advice.\\n<bot>: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor. Bloating and vomiting are nonspecific symptoms, but these lumps you're feeling are definitely something that must be evaluated! You should do at least ultrasound to rule some serious diagnosis out. Usually such symptoms are caused by gastritis, gErd or hiatus hernia, so gastrostomy should be performed too. There is no specific cure. If you have only gastritis this is treated by changing dietary habits. You should avoid alcohol, coffee,smoking, fats and fast food, carbonated Chat Doctor.  1 hour after meal you should not sit or lay. Also lay with elevated upper body. If you are overweight you should do often exercise. But as I said, I really suggest to DI some imaging tests do investigate these lumps. Wish you good health.\",\n",

As you describe both of you are perfect in the tests of gynecologist, you need not have this treatment. But if 3 years passed after the marriage, most of the doctors use this treatment.  Mention is a purified combination of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. To induce ovulation and enable pregnancy in women.  In women, Chat Doctor is used together with other hormones called follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in the treatment of infertility.  So there is every possibility of getting pregnant. It needs per vaginal ultrasound scanning at the time of expected ovulation, to see there is maturation of the follicles, and ovulation.  If you don't get pregnant in the first time, you may become pregnant you will become pregnant in the second cycle. So never get confused, or get anxiety, as they may spoil the process.

Sandra\\n<bot>: Hello and welcome to Chat Doctor. Thanks for your query. I understand that 600 dollars is a huge amount and it's even puzzling to me why a course of antibiotics and a cream would cost that much.  I presume that you don't have insurance, so the only option would be to be prescribed more cost-effective medication.  Furthermore, I would suggest that you can let the CRNP know that you cannot afford the medication and request her to prescribe something else more cost-effective and affordable. Since acne is not a serious condition, I don't think your grandson needs a very strong antibiotic or other expensive medication.  Wish you all the best. \",\n",

Should I be concerned about my heart rate?  The last time I was in the office it was 110 just sitting in his office.\\n<bot>: Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern, I would explain that your resting heart rate values are a little high, but they can be related to Adderall IR adverse effects (it is known to increase the heart rate by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system). As your blood pressure values are normal, the situation does not seem to be really concerning. But, I would recommend performing some other tests to be sure that everything is OK: - an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to examine your heart rate values for a prolonged time-complete blood count for anemia-thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance. If all these tests result normal, there is nothing to worry about. If your heart rate is persistently high, I would recommend discussing with your doctor on the possibility of reducing the dose of Adderall. Hope to have been helpful! Wishing good health, ',\n",

WHAT IS IT?! Is it deadly?! Can I cure it at home?! Please say yes! WHY IS IT THERE PLEASE HELP!!!\\n<bot>: Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint a dark purple lump next to molar tooth can be due to a dilated vein also known as Varicose vein or a Varix. The lump might be due to formation of a small blood clot that got lodged in that area forming a Thrombus. It is not AA serious condition and will not cause any serious problem. It can gradually reduce in size on its own. If it is not ruled out as the cause other causes can be like mucous cyst or Muscle, Hematoma or a Hematoma. Confirmation can be done by getting a clinical evaluation done by an Oral Physician or an Oral Surgeon. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor. ',\n",

Last year  blood work shows my white blood cell count to be slightly elevated but I have seen a oncologist who didnt find anything.  I also have been very tired and have been getting frequent headaches.  I was recently diagnosed with a autoimmune disease Vitilago.  I have seen a dermatalgist and endocrinologist.  No one has any answer.  Where do I go now?\\n<bot>: Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Hip and upper thigh pain which is of burning nature and is occurring more in sitting position especially in obese individuals (as in your case) is suggestive of NEURALGIA PARENTHETICAL. This condition results due to the compression of Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (pinched nerve) at the level of groin fold. A few conservative measures which are effective in treating this condition includes - wearing loose clothing (avoiding tightness at the level of the waist and groin fold), Losing weight, taking OTC pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) ibuprofen (Advil) or aspirin, Physical therapy to strengthen the muscles of the legs and buttocks etc. Other causes arising from the Hip joint are also to be excluded by having X-rays and MRI scans, which may also present with similar picture. So, I suggest you to consult an orthopedic surgeon for a detailed clinical examination and further management. Hope this information is helpful. Good day',\n",

Though in general if the tattoos are made in sterile procedure then there is no any harm of the same but in case if the tattoos are carved by unsterile needle or is made with infected needle then can transmit multiple infections.

Before you embark of such a tedious job let me assure that 85% population has at some point of time in life ectopic s, however most 99% of there are benign and not relevant clinically, so you should be worried it there are no associated symptoms Regards \",\n",

He is significantly older and seeming dismissive in general since I don t look sick.\\n<bot>: Thanks for posting your concern on Chat Doctor! I appreciate your concern towards the high ALT (SGPT) level. Age, gender, problem for which ALT is advised, and its duration, alcohol intake if any are not mentioned. Normal Adult Range for ALT : 0 - 48 U/Therefore, ALT in your case is slightly elevated. So, as your old physician suggested you need not have to worry about it. You need to have some lifestyle modifications to reduce the level of ALT. Daily physical exercise, eat healthy balanced diet preferably fresh fruits and vegetables which contain several anti-oxidants that help in reducing the ALT, AVOID ALCOHOL if any, avoid fatty vegan and non-vegan meals, fast junk foods, take plenty of oral fluids. INSA Allah, in due course of time your ALT will be normal. Wishing you best of your health.',\n",

I have gone through your query. The pain could be because of the infection in the root tip of the tooth. The home remedies will not help. We have to treat the cause by treating the tooth with root canal treatment or extraction. Consult your oral physician and get radiograph done and start with the treatment.

I feel traped,low sad and in fear whenever I think of applying for a job and feel that its not possible for me to attend an interview. Also I have sleep problems. I hardly get any sleep at night. Its sleepless nights and in the early morning I get a sleep of 5-6 hours. For this I have consulted a doctor and he has given me depran forte at night and I am using it since last 3 years. I get sleep almost at 3a.m. at night and wake up at 12 a.m. In morning. I take medicine at night around 9 p.m. although I have taken this medicine for 3 years I have not been able to apply for job until now as I still feel fear and I feel I cannot do it. Why is that the case still when I am taking medicine from last 3 years. Help me on this please.\\n<bot>: I guess the dose of medicine is not enough for you. I wonder why your doctor did not increase the dose. Also I prefer using Escitalopram and clonazepam as separate medicine not as combination like you are taking. Escitalopram is the main medicine which will help you to get rid of all depressive symptoms including decreased sleep, fatigue,low mood etc. clonazepam should be used for only initial phase of treatment when restoration of sleep and decreasing anxiety are preferred goals. Onces Escitalopram starts showing its effect. Clonazepam should be tapered and stopped. As long term use of clonazepam may decrease your thought process. Hope this would help you',\n",

Should I do something else?\\n<bot>: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, Rabies is 100% fatal, but it is 100% preventable by proper and adequate treatment and this is transmitted by dog bite. As your daughter was bitten by a vaccinated dog over the lip which has led to bleeding from the site, according to WHO it is categorized into Cat III. Even it is a vaccinated dog you need to doubly check whether it is properly and completely vaccinated, because the bite is on the lip which is closer to the brain and the virus can ascend easily and reach the brain and can affect it. So I would suggest you to take 1. Active immunization with antirabies vaccine on days 0,3,7,14 and 28.2. Passive immunization with Rigs around the wound.3. Oral antibiotic like Tab Augmenting, twice daily4. Topical Tract ointment.Don't take any risk with this disease, I would suggest your daughter to take aforementioned treatment. Thank you.\",\n",

Thank you for your query. I am Chat Doctor, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can. Premature ejaculation is uncontrolled ejaculation either before or shortly after sexual penetration. It happens with minimal sexual stimulation and before the person wishes. Most cases of premature ejaculation do not have a clear cause. With sexual experience and age, men often learn to delay orgasm. Premature ejaculation may occur with a new partner. It may happen only in certain sexual situations or if it has been a long time since the last ejaculation. Psychological factors such as anxiety, guilt, or depression can also cause it. In some cases, it may be related to a medical cause such as hormonal problems, injury, or a side effect of certain medicines. I hope I have answered you query.

What could this possibly be\\n<bot>: It sounds like stomach issue. All this is caused by high acid secretion which is found in gastritis, HERD or hiatus hernia.

There is mild global volume loss. Chronic microangiopathic changes in the old lacunar type infarcts and mild global volume loss.\\n<bot>: Hello, In relation to the fall that she took the CT scan doesn't show any damage due to the hit, none of those findings are related to the trauma, they were already present before she fell and hit her head. The findings are due to chronic changes in the brain matter and its blood vessels. Chronic microangiopathic changes are changes to the small blood vessels. To a point, they are genetically determined and are found in many people as they age. They are accelerated by factors affecting blood vessels such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol etcetera. So the only thing that can be done to slow down this process is checking for the presence of those factors and ad Chat Doctor. As for the mild volume loss that means the mild shrinking of the brain. Again that is part of aging, all of us start to lose brain cells after our thirties, so as we age volume loss accumulates. So that finding depends a little on her age which you do not mention, the older she is, the more such volume loss is expected.

Dialysis also depends on the underlying cause of raised creatinine levels. If the creatinine was high due to obstruction caused by bladder tumor, removal of tumor will reduce the creatinine levels.

I dont know why this is happening, she is not running a fever nor is she complaining of stomach pains.\\n<bot>: Our stomach secretes acid which helps in digestion. It is secreted throughout the day.

But in the process of digesting the breakfast, the gastric acid becomes utilized and such a situation does not arise till next morning. Hence, she remains fine throughout the day.',\n",

Been to an allergist and told I do have even more allergies, but would not account for the high WBC. Sed rate slightly elevated. Please advise. Jen\\n<bot>: Hi and thanks for the question, Chronic elevation of the ABCs deserves a more critical evaluation. In your case especially, the association with increased ESR, fatigue and petechial suggest exclusion of a bone marrow malignancy, especially a leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy might be compelling. Secondly, I would to suggest carrying out Anti-nuclear antibodies, HLA27 and autism antibodies for your symptoms are also very compatible with systemic lupus erythematous, which is an autoimmune disease. The symptoms as I said are very suggestive of a leukemia. An appropriate diagnosis is critical, for the setting up of an appropriate treatment plan. Delayed diagnoses my make the prognosis more faint. I suggest you book an appointment with the hematologist, to rule out a leukemia or any possible blood malignancy, and possibly systemic lupus erythematous. Thanks for your question and hope this helps, Luchuo, MD.',\n",

However, it seems that you are using it even when there is no fever. Stop using it by the clock, and use it only if there is fever above 99.5 degrees F. Why did the fever occur? Most likely a virus, but it is safer to go to his pediatrician in routine hours within a day if possible. Use sponging as a tool to reduce fever - as your child had a fit in the past, don't allow the fever to rise beyond 100 F. I hope that helps. Best wishes.\",\n",

Yeast infection medicines dont work, rarely will an anti-itch cream work. It was localized on one side of my vagina for 10 years and had since spread to both sides. My family doctor just says to use anti-itch, but I think there s a bigger issue or a better answer. The left (original) side had turned a darker color and is thicker.

Psoriasis classically involves the extensors like scalp, elbows, knee, shins and lower back, but sites like maxilla, groin folds can also be involved either together with the extensors or solely, where it is classically known as inverse psoriasis would advise that you see a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis. Psoriasis in the body folds responds very well to topical steroids as well as topical immunomodulators like tacrolimus/pimecrolimus ointment. An OTC antihistamine once daily e.g. cetirizine would help you symptomatically with the itch. Regards',\n",

Liver enzymes might be elevated due to disease and this can lead to reduced synthesis of vitamin D. It will help to know by how much your liver enzymes are raised and then treat any condition that is causing it. Since the doctor has told not to worry therefore I think the liver enzymes are not very high to cause a concern. However, you might have vitamin D deficiency and this requires you to take supplement. The pap smear showing hyperplasia requires discussion with the pathologist. Hyperplasia itself does not indicate cancer but might be a precancerous stage. You might vitamin D for now.

              " \"<human>: Hello Doctor My child having 3years suffering from frequent fever from 15 days due to swollen glands on the neck .our doctor prescribed us delcon plus , new deletusP syrups and nutocef50 tablets ...is this a proper prescription even though he is getting fever for every six hours severely..please prescribe proper medicine. Thank-you Swaroopa.\\n<bot>: Hi... Recurrent fever with swollen glands in the neck for the past 15 days could be ABV infection or otherwise called infectious mononucleosis. It is a self limiting prolonged viral illness. Rarely it can cause complications. I will suggest you how a viral illness behaves so that you will be more confident. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Regards - \",\n",

When I use medicine I am feel better and when I stop to eat medicine it starts, kindly advise me medicine .\\n<bot>: Dear .... Many thanks for the mail. A slightly big liver usually does not mean anything serious unless the liver function tests show some abnormal readings. So an LFT needs to be done. Like wise ultrasound evidence of gas in the stomach also does not mean anything. You will require an endoscopy test if not already done and I need to know the report. If you feel better while you take medicine denotes that you have some acidity problem. I suggest you continue the same medicine till you send me the reports I asked for. Taking these medicines for a long period of time will not cause any harm. Rgards',\n",
              " '<human>: How is it that a medical expert could use the 1990 ACOR criteria for Fibromyalgia in July of 2009, when was the preliminary available? I don t have any money, I am now disabled and not working, I need help and some answers. Is this questionnaire set up to help or to make money? Sorry about the attitude but I am tired of trying to find the truth about my case and because I am unable to make the living that I once made because of the Fibro, I am left in the dark.\\n<bot>: Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical Musculoskeletal assessment is advised.a little knowledge about the fibromyalgia is needed. Fibromyalgia is a condition where the pain is in the fibers of the muscle. Each muscle is composed of multiple muscle fibers and inflammation happening there will lead to the dysfunction in the circuiting of the muscle fibers to produce the contraction and relaxation. Also to understand here that the medication is a symptomatic relief and not a long term solution as the body is a medicine of its own and medication used acts as a supportive therapy to allow body to heal on its own. Also, in my clinical practice most Fibromyalgia cases we recommend physical therapy, meditation and breathing exercises. As physical therapy will help improve the muscle refunctioning and also improve the metabolism and immune system to reduce the inflammation. Also, Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy have been useful to reduce the pain, but importantly exercises are the choice. Meditation helps improve the control over the anxiety and leads to cooling of aggression. Breathing exercises helps to improve the oxygen carrying blood cells which acts as a fuel in the metabolism and reduce the metabolic waste as well. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor. ',\n",

              " \"<human>: Hi,Im a 30 year old woman, Ive always been healthy but I have this problem since my 20s. Whenever Im nervous, anxious, emotional, really unhappy about something or really happy about something, I start sweating, my chest and neck become very hot and red blotches appear mainly in my chest very rapidly. Is is very disturbing in social situations. What can I do to solve this problem? Thanks\\n<bot>: Blushing is a common reaction. It may be a part of social anxiety disorder or social phobia. If blushing, sweating, along with possibly tremors or stuttering occur when you are in a social situation; you may seek the help of a psychiatrist. The other features of social phobia which you may be having are:1) Fear that people will evaluate you/ judge you negatively when you are in a social situation. Such fears are more likely in public speaking, talking to a crowd, or meeting many people at a party or social gathering.2) Many people have symptoms described in 1) above. But they should be severe enough to cause limitations in your functioning. Or you find the anxiety so severe that you avoid situations completely. This then leads to further social problems.3) You think this fear is excessive, but seem to have no control over it. There are medications as well as Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT) for dealing with social anxiety. The disorder is sometimes almost a part of your personality, that it stays throughout life. However, medications or psychotherapy will help you deal effectively with the symptoms. Do seek a psychiatrists' opinion on it.\",\n",

I know I have been experiencing headaches and neck pains as well. Im just concerned due to a previous aneurysm on right side in back of my head lower to neck.\\n<bot>: Hello, I can understand your concern. It is logical that you can assume it to be aneurysm again as you have had it before. However, if it was aneurysm, you should be feeling symptoms like pulsations, numbness over the area etc. What you are experiencing is a sharp and dull pain episodes in the cheek area which seems like pain from infection of the oral cavity or due to sinusitis. It could also be pain related to Trigeminal or Facial nerve. I would advise you to visit a dentist for examination of the oral cavity to look for presence of infection in the area. If dentist clears you for any loci of infection, an ENT specialist or physician can examine you for sinus or nerve related problems.

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. No, hemochromatosis does not cause difficulty to walk. 2. I am not sure if it is anything related to hemochromatosis as you can walk at nights and not in day. Are you able to move your limbs during daytime? If you are able to move any of the limbs, then you will require psychological support and counseling.3. Routine hologram along with serum iron investigations will give a guide on hemochromatosis.

Mirena is an intrauterine device. When with IRENA in you start getting severe pain in abdomen, the cause could be:1. The uterus cannot get adjusted with it and is trying to throw it out. This is more commonly observed in women without any previous pregnancy.2. There is infection in the uterus and the device.3. The device is trying to perforate through the uterus. You will have to report to the Gynecologist at the earliest. Ultrasonography/X-ray can reveal about the perforation aspect.

The side effect of Ventolin is increased heart rate but let me assure you that this is a very widely used medicine and well tolerated and so you need not worry about the side effects. Give your child steam inhalation twice or thrice a day and I think that she would get some relief. Also add some antiallergic syrup like Relent which will also help in diluting the cough.

It could be an allergy which increases with weather changes, dust, exposure to sun, certain plants, animals etc. Also, certain foods like nuts, seafood, processed foods, etc. You will need to keep a track of when exactly the rashes come up and if there is a common cause each time. Allergies generally reduce as the child grows, but repeated exposure to the cause can make it recur often. Use a mild sunscreen when outside. When rashes appear, apply a demonize cream on the face for 5- 7 days till rash subsides, no longer. Use an antihistamine like HY Chat Doctor.

Treatment for PCs begins with weight loss and metformin, if either or both are indicated, and then is individualized depending on the patients reproductive needs: oral contraception supplemented with Kantian Chat Doctor. To reinforce weight reduction+/- metformin is the recommended therapy. Role of fertility supplements is questionable. Consult your obstetrician for further management. Hope this helps.

Any suggestions to get rid of the noise?\\n<bot>: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Breathing difficulty, wheezing during lying down (sleeping) are seen with bronchitis and heart failure. So better to consult doctor and get done blood pressure monitoring, ECG, 2d echo, chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). ECG and 2d echo are needed for heart failure.

              " '<human>: Dear sir,Recently my Father-in-law(FIL) saw the Heart doc for ByPass related surgery. Doctor suggested to go for \"Ultra Sound Abdomen\" and \"Dopler study of renal arteries\" first as my FIL has very high BP(200/100).  \"Ultra Sound Abdomen\" report says \"Inter Polar cyst measuring 12 MM noted in the right kidney\" and \"Prostatomegaly\". I am worried, what does it mean?  Your guidance is highly appreciated.Thanks In Advance\\n<bot>: Hello dear, Thank you for your contact to Chat Doctor. I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Cyst in the kidney and high blood pressure is suggestive of the damage caused by the high blood pressure. High blood pressure in the kidney can cause damage on the renal calyxes and can cause cyst. It requires surgical correction. Further management of the blood pressure can also prevent further damage to the kidney. Prostatomegaly means enlarged prostate. Enlarged prostate usually occurs with being prostatic hypertrophy. This needs to be confirmed with the PSA level in the blood. It will be higher on the carcinoma of the prostate. If its carcinoma it needs to be managed as per the malignancy. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thank you, ChatDoctorInfectious diseases specialist, ChatDoctor.',\n",
              " '<human>: Hi,Ive been having a tootache for (approximatley) a week following a filling I hid. At first the pain was in my tooth and spread to around 3 other teeth to the left. However, the pain soon reached the gums like a throbbing pain or heart beat when Im lying down and is getting really painful and unbearable at times. I can now feel a small bump on my upper lip near the teeth. What could it be? (Im seeing my dentist today after I though I could deal with the pain)Thanks,\\n<bot>: Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query. The possible cause of plan is because of the tooth infection. The type of pain what you are getting is characteristic feature of pulpits. The lump could be because of the abscess formation. The normal filling will not solve the issue. The tooth has to be treated with RCT or extraction. Take a radiograph to rule out the infection. You can take a course of antibiotics like penicillin and metronidazole combination after consulting the physician. I hope my answer will help you. Take care',\n",
              " '<human>: last night while eating an orange I started to choke.  Iwas coughing quite hard and then I could not get an air. My chest was suddenly very painful and the pain radiated down both my arms. I blacked out and when I came to the orange piece was on the rug beside my mouth and the pain was gone.  What happened to me.\\n<bot>: Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You had choking and aspiration of food particles in trachea. Your symptoms are associated with eating. So by mistake when we aspirate food particles in trachea (wind pipe), it gets blocked. Due to this, we can not get air and hence we feel breathlessness. During this episode our body is deprived of oxygen and so black out is seen. To overcome this, violent coughing (reflex) is done by the body to cough put food particle. Once food particles are out, wind pipe is open, and you can breathe normally. So better to chew properly while swallowing. Do not speak much while eating. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.',\n",

Thanks\\n<bot>: Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Read your query. Excess tissue growth with ill-fitting denture as you have described is usually harmless referred as Ellis fissuratum. This is usually cause by chronic tissue irritation by an ill-fitting dentures and its response to the soft tissue. Biopsy is usually done to rule out any other lesions including neoplasm. I would suggest you to go ahead with surgical removal of the tissue. After the healing get a new denture done with proper fitting and proper maintenance of the denture. Hope this was useful.

We had IVF to conceive our first child so did not believe it was possible to fall pregnant naturally otherwise I would not have carried on taking tetrasyl. How dangerous is this to our unborn child? Very concerned and would appreciate some advice.\\n<bot>: Hi there,Tetras is an antibiotic which is not recommended to be taken in pregnancy, but it is not known to cause any major defect in the baby if taken during the first trimester. Studies have shown that it effects the baby if taken after 4 months of pregnancy, causing the babies teeth to be discolored and can cause hardening and cause excess calcification of teeth and bones which is irreversible. But, since you are exposed to tetracycline at such an early gestation it is very unlikely to have affected your baby. Only minor abnormalities are known to occur in few women. Do not be overly concern and get a NT scan at 11 weeks and an anomaly scan done at 20 weeks to check for anomaly. Hope this helps. Regards.',\n",

The underlying pathological mechanism involves a loss of image stabilization by loss of reflex control of eye muscle control when a person has their gaze fixated.

On your description - not painful, hanging (which I assume you mean not firmly attached but mobile) and the recent onset - I can tell that there is no likelihood of serious infection or dental cyst/tumor.

Try not to disturb it though, and if you develop signs of infection (reddening, fluid discharge, multiple sores in mouth etc.) get it attended immediately.

Then it went away for a day and came back worse the next day. I am still experiencing it four days later. what is the problem?\\n<bot>: Hello! I understand your concern. In my opinion the dizziness and imbalance you have may be related to a cervical spine problem. It may be just degenerative changes of the bones or the disc, pressing on your vertebral artery which supplies the brain. I would recommend you a X-ray of cervical column. Heat procedures and a cervical collar would improve your situation. I would also recommend betahistine twice daily or finalizing for the dizziness. Hope to have been helpful!

              " '<human>: Hi, I m 22 and have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis on my face, scalp and torso. I ve exhausted most topical creams and ointments, taken courses of steroids with no real results. Would phototherapy be my next course of action. Is thinking about biologics too radical?\\n<bot>: Hello. Thank you for writing to topical treatment with ointments and lotions is usually combined with systemic treatment/ oral treatment for psoriasis involving > 20% body surface area. Phototherapy, though is a good choice for extensive body involvement with plaque psoriasis, however, certain body sites like scalp are resistant even to phototherapy. Apart from phototherapy Oral methotrexate is a well known treatment for plaque psoriasis and can be considered in a healthy young adult. Biologics like golimumab, ustekinumab are not first line options in a young patient with limited involvement with plaque psoriasis. Scalp involvement responds well to topical steroids lotions with or without salicylic acid. Vitamin D analogues e.g. calcitriol/ calcitriol lotions are also effective in scalp psoriasis. I suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region. Your dermatologist will assess the severity of involvement and advice accordingly. Regards',\n",

It may be an old impression of the fracture. If the child has achieved all the milestones normally and there is no history of recent trauma, it will not be a matter of concern.

Thanks for an elucidated history, which say you have walked 45 miles too. This indicates that there is no intra-abdominal problem. The vibration in the left lower abdomen looks to be due to the tics of the musculature of that part of the abdominal wall possibly due to a pinched nerve, or an automatic discharge of the nerve or may be a disc in the thoracic region.

Throughout pregnancy, the fetus bathes in a translucent pouch that gradually fills with amniotic fluid until the 35th week of amenorrhea where the amount of fluid is at its maximum with about 980 ml. Then the amniotic fluid decreases to the end to reach a volume between 600 and 800 ml approximately. The flow of the amniotic fluid signals the rupture of the membrane, and the risk of premature delivery if the term of the pregnancy is not reached. When the amount of amniotic fluid is abnormally low compared to the term of pregnancy, it is called oligoamnios. During oligoamnios, infection rate is higher. The premature rupture of the membranes (rupture before the beginning of the work) concerns 5 to 10% of the pregnancies. Its risk factors are the same as those of spontaneous preterm birth with intact membranes. This patient received a punch on her abdomen, which caused a premature rupture of the membranes and then a loss of the entirety amniotic fluid then an oligoamnios was created, and during the 2 weeks before the hospitalization, there was infection of the genital and baby components and infection dissemination by haematogenous route Causing endocarditis.

If you cannot read the urine test properly, you should go for the serum beta-ChatDoctor titles along with a trans-vaginal sonogram to clarify the issue. The spotting could possibly be due to an implantation bleed, but, it needs to be clarified.

Early pregnancy may naturally have periods of episodic vaginal bleeding with clots. This is caused as the baby with the sac in early pregnancy is too small to fill up whole of the uterus. The exposed inner lining of uterus may degenerate and bleed just like a normal menstrual cycle. I am assuming that your ultrasonography after the gush of bleeding showed a live baby with evidence of fetal heart beat. In that case chance of abortion is minimal. ASA or aspirin tablets are given in pregnancy to help in free flow of blood between mother and fetus. Please write back if you have any more queries.',\n",

It means the inside layer of uterus called as endometrium is present outside the uterus, and it responds to the cyclical changes as inside uterus causing bleeding. As you have menses, there will be bleeding from this endometrium which can be present anywhere in the abdomen.the commonest site is ovary and all around outer side of uterus. So premenstrual there will be pain which depends up on the organ involved and the extent.

              " '<human>: My husband was on hemodialysis for about a year.  Last December we began with peritoneal dialysis at home and have been doing this for almost a year.  He had his catheter moved last June as it was much too low.  Since then he has been retaining fluid in his abdomen.  He recently had a CAT scan and a ecocardiogram which showed a heart problem which his doctor said could be controlled with medication.  While in the hospital, his blood pressure dropped so low he was given a bag of saline solution which raised it but he was taken off this medication for his heart.  Now he is at home and has a physical therapist come to our home twice a week and he is doing light exercises but his biggest problem, which has been with him for about three months, is shortness of breath.  It is from all of the fluid in his abdomen pressing on his diaphram, etc.  He has increased his trouser size by two inches.  I called this to the attention of his nephrologist as his stomach is like a big bowl of jelly.  Nothing is being done to take care of this fluid except the doctor has put him back on hemodialysis with no reduction of fluid.  Is there a possibility that there is a leak inside from his catheter or could it be a buildup of fluids from the peritoneal dialysis which I understand does not always completely flush all the fluids out of his body?

Thank you in advance.\\n<bot>: HIT hanks for your query. If there is no active peritoneal dialysis going on, then the abdominal fluid collection is unlikely to be related to the Peritoneal dialysis catheter. Ascites or fluid in the peritoneal cavity can be due to a weak heart or liver problems. I would recommend a 2D Echocardiogram, Ultrasound of the abdomen and a diagnostic ascetic fluid tap. Based on the results we could make further recommendations. Hope this helps Good luck.',\n",

Coughing and itching are characteristics for allergic disease (process). Since you are having symptoms mostly at night, you may be allergic to your night clothes or bedsheet or pillow covers etc. And these act as allergen and cause symptoms. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to diagnose bronchitis. Change your bedsheet, pillow cover and night clothes. Start using new cotton ones.

There is a form of oral contraception where essentially it is taken for 3 months so that these women have only 4 periods a year.

I m very scared right now and I will not hear from my doctor until some time next week.\\n<bot>: Hello Your report suggests splenic cyst. It is not necessarily a cancer. It is the most common focal lesion of the spleen. Splenic cyst may be benign, malignant, or it may be abscessed also. It may be developed due to trauma, parasite infection etc. Usually splenic cysts are asymptomatic and incidentally discovered during imaging. You may need CT scan of abdomen. Small and asymptomatic cysts do not require treatment.Whereas symptomatic cysts are managed surgically. Take Care Chat Doctor. ',\n",

I am sad to hear about your brother health. Neuronal injuries are often permanent, so complete recovery is rare in such cases. Over a period of time some improvement in memory and behavior is possible.  After brain injuries some personality changes are possible which can lead to aggressive behavior. In such cases low dose anti-psychotic medicines are helpful. For that you can consult some nearby psychiatrist. Wish you all the best.  Chat Doctor. 99doctor.com',\n",
              " '<human>: Hi so I m pretty sure its my first molar on the bottom right side that i got extracted on Monday Feb. 11th. For the first 2 days I slept and took the painkillers and Ibuprofen that they had prescribed but since then my gum on the outside feels sore and kind of raw. As if my cheek is rubbing against it and the second premolar feels like its shifting downwards a little bit. Sometimes it still feels like i have a massive tooth pain there and also my teeth on the other side of my mouth are starting to hurt a little as well(Also the tooth they extracted was abscessed). Is this all normal? I m 21 and haven t had a tooth removed since I was 5 and it s kind of freaking me out that my mouth hurts this bad still since its been 5 days. Also I was curious on why I m 21(22 in may) and haven t gotten my wisdom teeth in yet.\\n<bot>: Hi and welcome to Chat Doctor, As you have mentioned the first molar you got extracted was involved with abscess. So after extraction the socket needs to be curetted to remove the pus pocket and all the debris and irritants, disinfection of the socket is done, and then the wound is packed with cotton gauze .any remnants of abscessed tissue in the socket may lead to infection and pain. Secondly you may have developed a condition of Chat Doctor.  You need to get it clinically examined by a dentist to confirm and make a diagnosis. Pain the other teeth may be due to gingival infection which can be cured by scaling and root planing. About wisdom teeth, they normally erupt at the age of 18 to 27 years, so you can still wait as you will get the eruption signs once they appear. I would suggest you to get an OPG radiograph done which will show the wisdom tooth appearing as well as infection in other teeth if any, will help in deciding treatment. I hope I answered all your doubts, take care.',\n",

It is a condition where gum line with respect to the tooth shows severe recession and exposure of the root surfaces of the teeth.  It is caused due poor oral hygiene, improper brushing and flossing that leads to accumulation of bacterial plaque and calculus deep in the gum pockets and root surfaces of the teeth.  Yes CLINDAMYCIN is an antibiotic which can be used to prevent infection and suppress further damage, but antibiotic will work better when you get the gum treated by dental procedures. It needs to be treated by thorough professional deep scaling of gums and root planing of the teeth to remove all the irritants, this will help in resolving the symptoms followed by a course of antibiotic and analgesics.

Now, this is not related to the knee. As you never mentioned the injury, so I suspect that you haven't had any. This burning sensation is related to the nerve root. Due to weakness in the spinal region, the nerve root gets impingement.

Since your blood pressure was so low, the first thought is that you were simply not getting enough blood to your brain. From you symptoms it sounds like your left hemisphere of the brain was affected given that you couldn't move your right leg and arm. Language also resides most commonly in the left hemisphere, so speaking would also be difficult. You didn't mention your age, but when symptoms are isolated to a side of the brain, what needs to be done is an MR-Angiogram (blood vessel imaging with MRI) or CT-angiogram (blood vessel imaging with a CT) of the arteries in the neck and brain to make sure that there is no narrowing of the blood vessel that could result in the symptoms just affecting one side of the brain. If neither of those tests are possible, then as a bare minimum a carotid ultrasound should be done. Alternatively, but much less likely is that you could have a migraine that caused paralysis and focal neurological symptoms. They are very rare, but still a possibility. The symptoms usually resolve in a few hours to a day. Lastly, a seizure could have also occurred which caused you to lose consciousness. There is a condition where after the seizure, it takes the brain time to recover and there can be difficulty with movement and language. Again, I feel that that is less likely. None-the-less you need more testing done to make sure the blood vessel are open. Also, they need to investigate the cause of your low blood pressure. It can be due to a Chat Doctor.  You should definitely speak with your primary care physician to have all of that investigated. I hope this helps. Sincerely, Kristoffer Mission\",\n",

Some natural remedies are-mixture of lemon juice and cream; apply on face. Put lemon juice onto basil leaves. This is great for getting rid of pigmentation marks and dark circles that may have been a long-time problem. Apply lime (NIMBY) to the affected area, and after 15 minutes wash it off. This needs to be done on a daily basis. Other remedy is Comic acid cream which lightens up the dark spots but takes some time. However, mellow is a facial treatment using Vitamins and Mineral injections to add that healthy glow to skin which radiates energy and vitality. Subdermal vitamin injections rejuvenate the cells, making them more active and thereby stimulating the production of collagen and elastin. Overall it reduces dark spots; effects seen faster than comic acid. You can continue same treatment for dark spots along with natural remedies and sunscreen creams. Take care. Best regards,',\n",

The findings were that 1) bilateral hilar prominance was noted due to vasculature as opposed to enlarged lymph nodes. 2) septal thickening of both lungs Do you know what causes this? I no longer am experiencing shortness of breath, but I still have weasing in my bronchial tree. I am not a smoker. I am 51 and have been battling osteomyelitis in my great toe which was recently removed. I now am on six weeks of IV antibiotics administered through my PICC line. Thank you, Bri\\n<bot>: Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out bronchitis. Age more than 50 is an individual risk factor for bronchitis. You are also having wheezing with shortness of breath, these also favors possibility of bronchitis more. Bilateral septal thickening is also seen in bronchitis due to inflammation. So consult pulmonologist and get done PFT. PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but also tell you about severity of the disease. And for treatment severity is important. You may require inhaled bronchodilators. No need to worry much for septal thickening in both lungs.',\n",

This type of syncope is often triggered by stress such as fear of needles, fear of heights, long periods of standing and in the same position, hot and stuffy places. Usually there is complete loss of consciousness, which can last a few seconds and the patient wakes up slowly, often with nausea and dizziness, and skin pallor and general ma-being.

              " '<human>: Hi, I m a 14 year old black girl . I used to have acne for 2 years but it has gone now but I have been left with hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, upper arms and upper back. I am currently using Lush products (only cleanser, toner and moisturiser) which have been working well. However, I would like a very effective solution that would hopefully solve my hyperpigmentation please. Thank you.\\n<bot>: Hello thanks for using Chat Doctor .  I would be pleased to answer your question For the hyperpigmentation, the best option is to get your skin exfoliated by a better method like a glycolic acid peel done every 15 days. A better option for you would be to visit a Dermatologist to avail of these peels. Alternative peel treatments like trichloroacetic acid are also very useful. I would suggest you get your skin examined by the dermatologist.  For a home based treatment, Application of vitamin C based serum can be safe over long run. Thanks and take care.',\n",

You can use site baths to see if it helps. This would involve sitting in a site bath with warm (not hot) water for 10 to 15 minutes, 2 to 3 times daily. Normally table salt or Epsom salt is added to the water. The use of anti-inflammatory painkillers would also help e.g. naproxen, ibuprofen or Catalan hope this helps',\n",

I can wipe until clean and an hour later I burn and itch and wipe again and it s like I never wiped the first time....\\n<bot>: Hi, From history it seems that there might be having some local skin infection like dermatitis or yeast infection. Due to lack of personal local hygiene this problem might be there. Clean the part gently without giving more pressure and apply triple action cream. Take Cetirizine or Levi cetirizine for itching. In absence of itching there will be speedy healing. Take plenty of water. Avoid constipation. Clean local part with running tap water thoroughly. Ok and take care.',\n",

              " '<human>: i have a good friend with multiple myeloma.  he suddenly has developed a raspy voice.  He has multiple hairline fractures in his spine and ribs and has become quite stooped and seems to have difficulty breathing.  Is the raspy voice related to the condition of his spine\\n<bot>: Hi, Thanks fir writing in. A raspy voice is due to stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve which supplies the vocal cords. It is possible that your friend has a lowered immune status after taking treatment for multiple myeloma. This might cause him to have infection in the throat which is causing irritation to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Any infection or condition in the throat might cause the raspy voice. It is suggested that he consults the ENT specialist immediately and has a clinical examination of his throat done. This will show any inflammatory changes in the region and whether it requires treatment. Please tell him to do throat gargle with warm water twice daily to soothe the throat. The raspy voice is not related to his spine but might have an indirect association to his treatment which he is getting right now. Please do not worry.',\n",

Candid B cream is an antifungal cream with steroid. This cream is used only in specific dermatological conditions as prescribed a qualified physician. There are a variety of skin disorders causing dark pigmentation. The commonest cause of dark pigmentation on cheeks in an elderly lady is a condition called Plasma. The cause of plasma is complex. There is a genetic predisposition to plasma, with at least one-third of patients reporting other family members to be affected. In most people plasma is a chronic disorder.  Sun exposure, pregnancy, hormonal changes, photo-toxic reaction to Scented or deodorant soaps, toiletries and cosmetics or medications are the commonest triggering factors of Plasma. There are different modalities of treatment for Plasma and I would recommend you to consult a qualified Dermatologist for an expert opinion regarding your mothers skin condition and treatment.',\n",

Possibilities of metastases can not be ruled out (in your case) without an FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology of an enlarged lymph nodes.2. Generally lymph nodal enlargement is seen after local or systemic, infection or inflammatory cause. And ease off after treatment.3. You have done MRI - it would have given you the status of the old treated tongue malignancy. A computer tomography with contrast will help to see the status of previous malignancy.4. Get an ultrasound abdomen done - to see the status of liver and abdominal lymph nodal enlargement.5. Get an FNAC of lymph node for confirmation and treatment to commence. Good luck.

Sometimes, a person can be attentive to an interesting thing for more than 30 minutes, such as movies or games. Concentration is attention plus understanding. For this too, span of below 30 minutes. If you are able to make your studies interesting and based on variable principle, your concentration level can be increased. Concentration comes only when you are interested in what you do.

There was no fetal pole and heartbeat but a gestational , yolk sac is seen. Doctor has advised scan after 10 days and said this will be the max waiting time for a fetal heartbeat. I am advised to take hormonal tablets (Conest). I am very much worried and really hoping the best for my baby. Can you please tell me how much possibility is there for a fetal heartbeat and fetaql pole after 10 days. Thanks in advance.\\n<bot>: Hallow Dear, Usually by 6 weeks or so the fetal pole and fetal cardiac activity is detectable by ultrasound. If by 7 weeks, it is undetectable, there are following possibilities:1. The ovulation and conception might have occurred late in the menstrual cycle, which otherwise happens 14 days before the next menstrual period.2. There could be mistake in calculating the duration of pregnancy.3. The pregnancy could be without embryo (baby). This is known as blighted ovum. In such case, the ultrasonography image shows corrugated margins of the sac. If the margins of the sac are well-rounded, in order to exclude the first two causes, it is a good option to repeat the scan after a week to 10 days. If still the sac is empty, then the diagnosis of blighted ovum is confirmed. However, if the edges are corrugated, it is blighted ovum. Pregnancies with blighted ovum do not grow. If such pregnancy does not abort spontaneously, termination is the requirement. I hope this helps you. ',\n",

              " '<human>: My wife age 38 is HBV positive with acute measure and Dr. has told that she is not in carrier stage and does not need any treatment. The quantitive test result somewhere 625. Can this HBV get removed completel, does this quantity increases in future, what could be the effect on liver functioning in future. Please explain.\\n<bot>: Thank you for posting query. Carrier state means that your wife is infected with Herb (Bag positive) but the replicating antigen of virus maybe negative and the viral load may NOT be high enough requiring treatment. Virus is in \"dormant\" phase. It is possible that the virus remains in dormant phase throughout and causes no harm to liver. Only one fourth of patients infected with Herb virus develop liver cirrhosis. Therefore, one cannot be sure about her status. The viral load should be monitored, and she needs to repeat test every 6 month or at least once a year. You should also inform your treating doctor if you want to plan a baby. There is NO permanent treatment for Herb virus. However, all relatives of your wife including you need to be vaccinated against Herb (if not done yet).wish her good health. Further queries are welcomed. Health professionals aim to diagnose properly and manage patients according to their limited knowledge. Cure is blessed by the ONE who Created us, whose power and knowledge is unlimited .wish you good health. Regards, Chat Doctor. ',\n",

Because there should be some degenerative changes of the knee joint and the ligament injuries.  Having an MRI or X-ray will be of God choice to understand the pathology.

You should give a trial to the medicine prescribed by your doctor. At this stage, in my opinion, the symptoms are likely to be due to an anxiety disorder. When you follow up with your doctor, you may ask questions you may have about specific medicines. You may consult a psychiatrist if your doctor is a general practitioner.

Another issue is that it can lead to pregnancy complications and birth weight issues. But at the same time it doesn't mean that all consanguineous marriages will lead to defective babies.

My fingers sooth me and keep me calm so i can sleep in a way nothing else can. i only do it at night and when im really tired.. please help\\n<bot>: Hi and welcome, Finger sucking and thumb sucking habit is very injurious as dental health is concerned. Although thumb sucking is a normal habit it causes serious teeth problems if it continues long after the eruption of permanent teeth.  Prolonged finger sucking can create crowded, crooked teeth and bite problems.  You may also develop speech problems or problems with swallowing properly.  Protrusion and displacement of front teeth are usual results of thumb sucking. This can affect your facial appearance and cause further emotional problems. You can follow few steps to avoid the habit :Ask your family member to carefully remove your fingers from mouth during sleep Don't be in anxiety or fear. If you have any emotional problems, or under stress, and you need comforting, you may need to resolve those issues first before successfully stopping the habit.  Use a finger sucking guard. - your dentist might suggest the use of special devices to stop thumb sucking, called finger guards. A finger or thumb guard is a device with a plastic cover of the thumb that is attached to wrist. . Treatment with thumb guards usually lasts four weeks and helps to stop thumb sucking successfully. I hope this helps, take care\",\n",
              " '<human>: I have been diagnosed with biceps tendinopathy and supraspinatus tenosynovitis of the right shoulder following a vehicle accident over 7 months ago and despite a steroid injection and months of physical therapy, I can barely move my right shoulder, is there any real help for this?\\n<bot>: Hello, As you met an accident where you were diagnosed with biceps retinopathy and supraspinatus tenosynovitis I wonder why the shoulder functions have not resumed even after 6 months. Have you taken an MRI of the shoulder? If so what was the reports? If not then please do take it. I suspect this to be a rotator cuff injury. Because any injury happening to the shoulder with two muscle injury falls in the group. The rotator cuff muscles are weak. You need to work out behind it. Shoulder function can resume only when we have good range of motion in passive for all the movements and also if we overcome the pain.  In fact, I should share one of the rotator cuff injury cases of mine. It was a case of 65 years old female with the above-mentioned injury. No passive or active shoulder movements. But to overcome the problems, I use to make the muscle tire by active ROM exercises and no weights. Just gravity assisted and gravity resisted ones. In fact all the shoulder movements like - flexion, extension, rotation, abduction, adduction and circumduction. At the end of the 12th week, she had the best movements without any kind of pain and shoulder was much stronger than before. I will advise you to look for a competitive physiotherapist who can help you get the best outcome score. If left untreated it will lead to other pathologies which are not accepted.

              " '<human>: MY 29 yr old son went to the emergency room 1month ago with a quarter size lump in his neck below the ear. they tried to drain it because they originally thought it was a cyst or an infected hair follicle. With in 4 days the lump was the size of a hockey puck and extremely painful. They did surgery to remove it, but didn t take it out 2x s. Once before a mri and petscan, and once after, but both times they just sewed him back up and said if they removed it, they would be doing more damage than the tumor. He says he has a non-cell malignancy. He told me today it is stage 4 melanoma. He is in his 4th week of daily radiation, but he said that he has been told he is inoperable, uncurable, but manageable. He originally told me that the tumor was solo, and not attached to anything when he had an ultrasound, but 4 days later when they did the 2nd surgery it has wrapped itself around things in his neck. What kind of cancer does this? Is he terminal?He lives in another state and I think he is keeping information from me to spare my feelings?\\n<bot>: Hi, Thanks for writing in. It appears that your son has a melanoma that might have spread to neck lymph nodes. This is a possibility and has to be confirmed by doing a biopsy. What happens is that lymph nodes are found in many regions of the body and are small unless they are stimulated by disease process. When there is a disease in a person then the lymph nodes of a particular region get enlarged and this is a reaction by the immune mechanism. Since your son has been told that he has a melanoma, it has probably involved the neck lymph nodes. The lymph nodes in the neck are close to the carotid artery and internal jugular vein, and it is possible that the lymph nodes have wrapped around these. Doing a surgery in this condition is not possible and radiation usually works. It is suggested that you spend some time with your son by going over to his place and know more about the treatment he should be taking for his condition. Please do not worry.',\n",

A phys therapist that was on the trip thought she may have popped a rib. She has no insurance. We can go to an urgent care facility but they dont have xray. Would that be required for treatment?  Thanks.\\n<bot>: GREETINGS! ANSWER : Fracture or dislocation of the rib can be only confirmed through X-ray. If it's a fracture or dislocation then, There is no specific treatment for rib fractures, but various supportive measures can be taken. In simple rib fractures, pain can lead to reduced movement and cough suppression; this can contribute to formation of secondary chest infection. Adequate analgesia can avoid this! Flail chest is a potentially life-threatening injury and will often require a period of assisted ventilation. Flail chest and first rib fractures are high-energy injuries and should prompt investigation of damage to underlying viscera (e.g., lung contusion) or remotely (e.g., cervical spine injury).

But my fther not happy with the numbness. so last week he start smoking ( he is a heavy smoker before but quit smoking after the CABG. he quit smoking for 8 month until recently ). He said the numbness gone after he start smoking. My question is, is nicotine or any substance in the cigarate have some effect on the the nerve or what so ever that can reduce or heal the numbness.TQ\\n<bot>: Hello No it doesn't have any favorable effect on nerves, it's just his psychology and the urge to smoke in his subconscious that is making him feel in a better way. Smoking even after a CABG is highly inappropriate as smoking promotes atherosclerosis and can lead to a very early graft failure that could ultimately lead to a heart attack. So you have to make sure that he should stop smoking completely. Wish him good health Regards\",\n",

Then your body brought the familiar symptom because you are expecting it. Then you started worrying that the symptom is coming again and again and expect it.

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You must know that Adderall is a stimulant of central nervous system. It affects chemicals in the brain that contributes to hyper reactivity. Through stimulation of nervous system in a secondary way it stimulates the electrical system of the heart. This stimulation might cause fast heart beats over 100 or generate other electrical impulses in parts of the heart different from normal sinus Rhythm. This causes premature heart contraction that we call extra systolic beats. In this situation you feel your heart like running, making pauses or skipping beats. You might feel anxiety, difficulties in breathing deeply, palpitations or pulsations to your veins all over. Every kind of stimulation of nervous system might cause this rhythm issue to simple emotional stress, coffee consumption or pathologies like anemia, hyperthyroidism, this kind of medicine that act directly to the system. So, nothing serious is happening to your heart. it's a reaction to this stimulation. My opinions is to discuss this effects with your doctor and decide together what to do with and fit is possible or allowed to stop it. Hope I was helpful. Best regards.\",\n",

Possible causes can be contact with any allergens, fungal or bacterial infection etc. It is very important to diagnose the problem exactly. Sometimes if you have this issue, using of soap and other creams can aggravate the issue. It is advisable you contact a dermatologist and get treated as soon as possible, and if it is due to any allergy (some people will even have latex allergy), avoid the contact with such allergens, and if this particular problem started after a sexual intercourse with a particular person, inform that person also to get treated.

It appears that your husband has developed irritant dermatitis after applying the meet cream over the genital area. These creams are quite prone to cause the burn on the skin and therefore can cause damage leading to oozing of blood from the affected site. I suggest you to ask him to do cold compression over the affected area.

However, the history of ectopic pregnancy cannot be ignored, and you will have to be on the guard for it. The best option is to monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography and time your sexual intercourse on the day of egg release. You will have to submit for the ultrasonography day 9 onwards for about 5-6 days. This should give you better results. If you choose to have pregnancy when the egg from the side on which tube is intact is selected, the chances of pregnancy will still be higher. I hope this helps you.',\n",

I have a bruise at the location of the pain -- probably because I am a student and my back is constantly being pressed against hard desk chairs. When I run my fingers along my spine, I do notice a slight protrusion at the source of the pain -- I m not sure if it can be seen, but I can feel it.

I understand your concern. In my opinion a disc bulge in that level of your column may be the cause of these symptoms. The protrusion may be an inflammatory lesion, or just the bone related with your spinal nerves at the point of the column where they get out from the spine.

Is this a side affect of gargling hydrogen peroxide or may this be caused be something else?\\n<bot>: Hello, Thanks for writing to shy Chat Doctor.  Less complex molecules that reflect less light lead to a reduction or elimination of the discoloration of both the enamel and the dentin. The length of treatment depends on the level of discoloration and on the whitening product used. It ranges from short interventions in the dental office to applications at home lasting minutes/hours per day and repeated over a number of days. Single dark teeth can also be bleached successfully. Heavy tobacco stains may need as much as three months of treatment. Whitened teeth generally do not darken after treatment or darken only slightly, and when they do, retreating the teeth can easily be done. Hope this helps you. Wishing you good health...

Antibiotics quite often cause some gastrointestinal issues. Like every medicine they can irritate stomach causing stomach ache. Usually it is nothing serious, however if it starts recurring, some diagnostics is necessary. Swollen gallbladder should rather get better after antibiotics. So it is hardly possible that antibiotic itself has caused such issue. More possible is that your son has peptic ulcer which get irritated by antibiotic. In case of peptic ulcer, ultrasound is usually useless. I suggest your son to visit a doctor once again. CRP, and blood work should be done along with an ultrasound. If nothing will be found, gastrostomy should be next. Hope this will help. Regards.',\n",

Yesterday morning the swelling had spread to all 4 small toes and into my foot. My doctor prescribed prednisone and topical steroid cream. Also told me to take zyrtec or clariton over the counter. I took the steroid and it seemed to reduce the swelling but by the evening two of the insect bites were black and the surrounding area was also black and swollen. I soaked my foot in epsome salts that helped the pain and reduced the redness and swelling some. Today the bites are still very black and swollen but not exceptionally painful. Should I be concerned? Should I lance them and soak again?\\n<bot>: Hi, thanks for using Chat Doctor It would be best not to puncture them because they can introduce infection if the technique is not sterile. You may want to add anti-inflammatory painkillers to your current regimen. They would help with pain relief and also reduce the inflammation due to the bites. Examples are ibuprofen, naproxen should continue your other medication and can also the foot baths. It is possible that the bites may become infected so if there is no improvement you may need a course of antibiotics. I hope this helps',\n",

Runny nose is mostly due to viral infection because of our low immunity. You may need to do complete hologram, ESR,electrolytes and X-ray of face to check for sinusitis.

I have a history of panic attacks, and this occurs during them, but at the moment, I am not having an attack.  Could this be something other than stress?\\n<bot>: Hi, Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns. It is not a vein but an artery, more specifically, the superficial temporal artery which pulsates. It is a branch of the external carotid artery. Furthermore, it occurs in anxiety disorders. Pulses can be abnormally strong when the patient has an elevated pulse pressure.  This would result in a strong, bounding pulse that could also be asymmetric due to anatomic variation. Bounding pulse -commonly seen in hyperkinetic circulatory states where there is vasodilation and increased stroke output. The pulse volume is high (due to high pulse pressure) with increased blood flow. Hyperkinetic circulatory states may due to excitement/anxiety. Other causes of hyperkinetic circulatory states giving rise to bounding pulse are Hyperthyroidism, Severe anemia, Beri Berg (thiamine deficiency), Arterio-venous fistula (e.g. Pages disease or hepatic failure). The most rapidly rising bounding pulse is found in AR(aortic regurgitation), PDA(patent ducts arterioles), coaptation of aorta. Regards ',\n",

Since you are a active smoker, possibility of bronchitis is more for your symptoms. And you are not improving because you are not taking appropriate treatment for bronchitis. Bronchitis needs inhaled treatment. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis, but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.

I understand the ischemic colitis is caused by lack of blood flow to the colon.  What causes the lack of blood flow?  No doctor can answer that yet.\\n<bot>: Hello Welcome to Chat Doctor Ischemic colitis is caused due to obstruction to blood flow of the colon. Cholesterol deposition in the arteries of the body lead to narrowing of the arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. Some subjects have increased tendency to atherosclerosis which depends on genetics and environmental factors. This causes narrowing of the arteries leading to stagnation of blood at these sites and subsequent formation of clots. This causes you the attacks of ischemic colitis. In you case since you have suffered from two heart attacks, I suppose you have got high propensity to atherosclerosis, may be due to genetic factors and strong family history. Treatment is blood thinners like aspirin which I suppose you are already on. Usually two blood thinners are used on recurrent attacks of ischemic colitis and even in case of previous heart attacks. So ideally you must be on two blood thinners. If despite this you have episodes of ischemic colitis you must be on higher blood thinners like warfarin. However, higher blood thinners have a potential of causing bleeding elsewhere in the body. I hope I have answered your query satisfactorily. Wishing you good healthRegards.',\n",

I suggest you not to worry much. Derealization disorder is not a stand-alone disorder but dissociative symptoms of many conditions, in psychiatry and neurotic spectrum.

Psychological counseling helps you understand why depersonalization and derealization occur, and helps you gain control over the symptoms so that they go away. Two such techniques include cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy. Depersonalization-derealization disorder may also improve when counseling helps with other mental health conditions, such as depression.

This report broadly means that you might be having hypertension which is causing pressure on heart & causing thickening of a chamber of heart (LVH). It is also telling that one side of heart is working less than other parts(hypokinetic inferior wall), which may be because of blockage of one of the arteries of heart. Rest everything is fine.

My vagina was also just aching. I didn t start when I was supposed to and now my period is light but the blood coming out is clotty and jelly like and dark black. My tampon wont even absorb it. I was scared I was pregnant when I was late, but now I m not sure if I should be worried about that or not. What is going on?\\n<bot>: Hi, In the current scenario, you would need a pelvic examination and a trans-vaginal sonogram to know the exact cause. Pelvic causes like pelvic inflammation and endometriosis should be considered. An urinalysis also should be performed to exclude any associated infection. Endometriosis can also give such a picture of sticky bleeding. Pregnancy is not likely with such symptoms. A pelvic antibiotic and hormonal treatment should alleviate the symptoms. Metonymic acid and dicyclomine can be taken to relieve the pain. Hope this helps.',\n",

I followed it for some time and could not find much improvement after stopping the painkillers. I went back to the doctor again for a better advice. He suspected something peculiar now and referred me to a pain and rehabilitation clinic. I got the diagnosis there. Do you know what it is a Computer related Injury (CRI)?

I would recommend you have a cervical CT scan to visualize the discs and find out where the problem is.

In view of all these symptoms started after prolonged abusive masturbation I think the prolonged masturbation has caused trivial damage to urethra resulting to form a scarring and flimsy stricture of urethra. I would suggest you to consult your urologist again and explore need for doing endoscopic examination of urethral passage (Ureteroscopy). This procedure of visualization of urethral passage directly perhaps may help to diagnose the precise cause for your symptoms. Further treatment will be decided by him on final diagnosis. There is no possibility of pinching of any nerve as it never happens in reality. Chat Doctor. ',\n",
              " '<human>: I have been diagnosed yet again with another UTI with Klebsiella being the bug that is always found in my urine. The dr says it is not caught from my partner but every time I have sex with him I am back to the Drs again complaining of the same symptoms. Sometimes the urine samples show nothing but most of the time it does. Why is it that I no sooner get rid of the infection then have sex and the infection starts all over again. I m beginning to wonder if my partner is the cause of all of this. Never ever had this issue before with any other partner. I m in my 40 s and have been with my partner for 2 years and am completely monogamous (never have numerous partners). I m so over this please help me\\n<bot>: Hello, Klebsiella is mostly and primarily found in not immunocompetent individuals, usually in hospital settings and cause the so-called hospital-acquired infections (HAI). They could cause opportunistic urinary tract infections, pneumonia and other respiratory infections, bacteremia, infection of surgical wounds, etcetera. In diabetics, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etcetera. Due to their particular structure, Klebsiella species are naturally resistant to penicillin-type antibiotics, some Aminoglycosides (Gentamicin, Kanamycin, Streptomycin, etcetera.). Often their treatment is possible only through the use of Carbapenems and Fluoroquinolones (Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, etcetera.). Klebsiella is considered part of the normal flora in various parts of intestine and colon. Recent studies have reported that recurrent Klebsiella urinary tract infections are caused by persistent Klebsiella found in the urinary tract even after appropriate antibiotic treatment and all persons with recurrent infections were elderly and diabetics. Recurrent strains of Klebsiella also had increased adhesion and invasiveness compared to colonization strains (those causing infection for the first time) and this might explain their tendency to cause repeated infections. Now, it is known that frequent sexual intercourse is the strongest risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections in healthy women, and it is why your disease comes back each time you have sex with your partner. The fact that the disease comes back after you have sex with your partner puts in high risk of future urinary tract infections. In your case the following measures could be of benefit: 1. Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for six months, by using low doses of the antibiotic that is more effective in your case. You have to consult with your doctor about which antibiotic you will use and for how long.2. Post-coital therapy, by applying a single dose of the most effective antibiotic each time after having sex. You again have to consult with your doctor about the dose and type of antibiotic. 3. Apply the so-called post-coital voiding that is: urinating immediately after sex.4. You should maintain high genital hygiene as it could help as well. It is also important that you have a thorough evaluation by radiological examinations in order to rule out abnormalities of the urinary tract (anatomical or functional) that could boost infection recurrence. Lastly, Klebsiella is not transmitted sexually, thus clearly your partner has nothing to do with your recurrent infections. But, during each intercourse, it is easier for the bacteria to get contact with your urinary tract (remember that Klebsiella is a normal part of intestinal tract and colon). Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.  ',\n",
              " '<human>: Hello doctor. I have been havin a toothache since few days. I ws told few months back that the tooth needed a root canal. A temporary coverin ws done but within days it came off and exposed tooth since then. I ws advised meftal - forte tablets to take for pain by a chemist. Please advice ASAP if i should take to subside the pain for now. Within 2 or 3 days i would be visiting a good dentist. Thank you!\\n<bot>: Hello, I am glad to assist you. The temporary filling placed would be expected to wear away if only placed to cover the tooth while expecting you to return for a root canal therapy. The filling needs to be removed to enter the center of the tooth and clean out the canals to complete the root canal. You will have a temporary filling until the canals are sealed, and you can plan restorative treatment with your dentist. An antibiotic such as Amoxicillin may be necessary if pain and swelling is present. This will help control the spread of inflammation from the infected tooth. I usually recommend taking a combination of two Advil and two extra strength Tylenol to control a more severe pain until you are able to visit the dentist again. Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you will feel relief soon.',\n",

It usually lasts about 2 days. 4 weeks ago I took a really sharp pain in behind my rib on my right side that went up into my right shoulder.

Doctor did an X-ray whicChatDoctore back clear, and done a ct scan as they suspected PE, this also came back clear. They told me my bloods came back that I had infection somewhere but they just didn t know where and sent me home with antibiotics. 4 days later I went back as I didn t feel 1 bit better, done another X-ray which was clear, more bloods and tested my liver this time as they were thinkin maybe gallbladder, al bloods came back clear, my liver slightly elevated but nothing to worry about , I think it came back 41 and doc said its usually 36, only bloods still showed infection, but doctor was baffled as to where the infection was.

Other ideas would be appreciated!\\n<bot>: Hi, thank you for choosing Chat Doctor.Sometimes kids are more hungry and cranky without an apparent reason. But just look for any ear ache or pain while passing urine which can make kids irritable and are usually missed. If she is not having these, then she is in the recovery phase from her cold which has increased her appetite. Just give her an extra meal for another week or so before going to sleep. Hope this has helped you. Your vote of thanks is appreciated, Good luck, Chat Doctor. ',\n",

              " \"<human>: I was recently diagnosed with a pituitary tumor, after going to a neurologist his assistant informed me that it is not a pituitary tumor but it next to it by my brain...The reason I even found out about this is through an MRI I had because of vision issues that I am having (double vision) the thing is this is the third incident it seems to come and go with the first time being in 2009, the second in 2011, both with pregnancies, and now this time while I was on an appetite suppressant. What do you think\\n<bot>: Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. If you had double vision, the tumor infiltrated cavernous sinus, and treatment depends on the kind of tumor. In that area three are the most probable lesions: Pituitary tumor, Meningioma and Chraniopharyngioma. If the size of tumor is small (below 3 cm) it could be treated by Radiosurgery, if it is greater than 3 cm it needs surgery.Don't delay treatment because there is a serious risk of blindness. Consult a Neurosurgeon. Hope this answers your question. If you have additional questions or follow-up questions then please do not hesitate in writing to us.

As per your age and history there is possibility of soft tissue injury in knee. Most commonly meniscus injury occurs. As per your symptoms you need to do physiotherapy and knee exercises to improve range of motion. If pain persist then you may need to do MRI again to see for any functional defect. Small meniscus tear can be managed conservatively with physiotherapy with USG and TENS. Meniscus injury can be managed by arthroscopic repair, and same day you can go home.

Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely because your pain is associated with specific position and movement. So avoid movements causing pain. Avoid sudden jerky movements of chest. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest.

              " '<human>: I am a 62 years old Male. I underwent a brain MRI examination the outcome was: Few tiny hyperintense foci are seen in both frontoparietal and left anterior peri insular white matter, which appear to be ischaemic/nonspecific, with none showing restricted diffusion. Question : What does that mean?\\n<bot>: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. I have noted your MRI brain findings. I would like to reassure you that these findings are not significant and do not represent any serious brain disease. I would like to know your clinical details (history and examination findings) in order to completely interpret your MRI findings. Hyperintense loci on MRI are most often due to migraine and ischemia (lack of blood flow to brain). Ischemia of brain occurs in people with high BP and sugars. At this stage, you need to keep your blood pressure and sugar under good control. In addition, aspirin tablets may be taken to prevent further ischemia. I hope my answer helps.

A thorough cardiothoracic assessment is advised. As the pain is persistent from past few months I will advise to take up a thorough cardio thoracic assessment if it is in the middle of the chest or above the abdominal region. You may be recommended x-ray or any other test based on the assessment the pain is below the xphisternum then I will advise to take a thorough abdominal assessment and a Diagnostic ultrasonography will be advised to see the soft tissue status. Also, if the pain is near to the rib joining the sternum then it could be Costco Chat Doctor. I will still advice to undergo at least a chest x-ray to check the soft tissue and bony status. No pain persists for longer months until there is something to understand about the physiology. Also, with breathing exercises if the pain subsides then you many not have to worry, as certain times due to weakness of the intercostal muscles there leads to pain. As no chest congestion, cough cold, abdominal pain is mentioned by you, I suspect it to be a Costco',\n",

I can understand your concern. The pain which you are describing can't be meningitis as in this infection the child is quite sick and is unable to flex his neck. Its probably sinusitis or could be viral flu both of which can have headache. I would advise giving him some good anti histamines like levocetrizine 5 ml at night or fexofenidine 6\\xa0mg /loratadine 10 mg once in the morning before going to school. You can also try some home remedies like 1 tablespoon of honey in a glass of Luke warm water once daily. Normal saline(2 ml) nebulization and especially steam inhalation also helps. Dnt worry he will be fine in 2-3 days with all this. Get him an X-ray PNS done, and his eyesight checked because sometimes it could be due to refractive error. Hope it will help.

As mentioned by you about the symptoms, since it is vasculitis we need to have patience for the bodies mechanism to function. As treatment of choice is always directed towards the symptoms. Also, as the fatigue and pain is the factor, taking physical therapy will be advised as per me depending upon the vascular assessment. By passive movements of the limbs it will help to maintain the normal muscle property and metabolism of the cells. Also breathing exercises will help improve the oxygen in blood cells, which will delay the fatigue and pain. Usually, physiotherapy is a non-invasive and no side effects' therapy. Avoid performing massage to increase the symptoms. Also icing can help. You can discuss the same with your vascular surgeon. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor. \",\n",

[/INST] Hello and I hope I can help you today.First there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive.  Medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant. The only issue is that certain medications may decrease a men sperm count and affect fertility however pain medications like Oxycodone do not have this effect. So there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication.  The best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects.

But the history of Dyspareunia meaning painful sex indicated the is some active inflammatory process still going on in the pelvis called PID-Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. Cystitis and Procto-colitis are the additional problems causing the pain in abdomen and rectum before and during bowel movements as also during urination. Ovarian cyst can cause problem only if it enlarges fast or gets twisted.

[/INST] Hallow Dear Since you are no more on the birth control pills now you are no more having any contraceptive protection. Pull out technique is not a safe and reliable technique for contraception. In this method the penis is pulled out of vagina before the ejaculation takes place. However before ejaculation pre-seminal or pre-ejaculatory secretions (pre-cum) are deposited in the vagina unknowingly. Pre-cum does contain some sperms which are capable of impregnating a woman. Now that you have missed your period please get your pregnancy test done on overnight morning first urine sample a week after the missed period; earlier the test may report false negative. Alternatively you may perform Beta Chat Doctor test on the blood. This will help you detect your pregnancy status. If you are not pregnant you may take some progestational preparation like Devilry for 5 days (with advice of a Gynecologist). Then within 4-7 days you should get with Chat Doctor.  However if you are pregnant you may opt for medical termination of pregnancy. Since you are regularly engaged in sexual activity and do not want to continue with oral contraceptive pills please adopt some other reliable contraceptive method like condom or intrauterine device.

[/INST] Hello I can understand your concern for abnormal blood report.1) Your symptom of loose motion might be due to indigestion. There is no role of antibiotic in this. Instead you should take intestinal digestive enzyme supplementation.2) Elevated SGPT level indicate either liver function is weak or liver has too much load to work. Fatty liver is condition in which excessive fat get deposited in liver tissue and affect liver function. This is the reason for elevated SGPT level in your case.3) Fatty liver is due to high level of fat in blood stream secondary to lipid (fat)-rich diet. This might lead to elevated cholesterol level. Thus it is recommended for you to undergo lipid profile test.4) Mild fatty liver is reversible condition. You should do - regular exercise intermittent fasting (weekly once) high protein diet low fat-diet use of omega-3 fatty acid containing oil in food preparation avoidance of alcohol intake.

In hot and humid climate most likely this is Emilia- small pimples over the skin due to clogging and blockage of sweat glands. In absence of secondary infection (painful / edematous / pus filled) this does not require any specific treatment other than avoiding direct sunlight and keeping the skin cool with wet moping 3-4 times a day(apart from routine bath).

A delay does not always mean a pregnancy it can also be due to the mental anxiety illness etc. She can test for a pregnancy using a home pregnancy kit about 4-5 days after the date of the missed period (assuming she has regular cycles). Ask her to use a morning sample preferably. If there is a doubt better do a pelvic ultrasound the week after. Do not worry seek a gynecologist opinion in case it is positive. All the best. </s>',\n",

It is quite common for kids to pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated. When the kid takes feeds the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastronomic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

It is a vitamin B supplement. Treatment is on right way for neuropathy but you have to be watchful for your sugar level. You have to take oral as well as intramuscular NSAID to subside pain.

I have not urinated blood Improvement in past 2 weeks seems minimal Please advise [/INST] Hello Thank you for writing to Chat Doctor about your query Brief Answer -Treatment for lower back pain depends upon the patients history and the type and severity of pain as you described I explained below meditation. Explained Answer -The vast majority of lower back pain cases get better within six weeks without surgery and lower back pain exercises are almost always part of a treatment plan. If pain persists or worsens more involved diagnostic and surgical procedures may be recommended.  Medications : A wide variety of over-the-counter and prescription medications is available to help reduce symptoms of lower back pain. Many medications reduce inflammation which is often a cause of pain while others work to inhibit the transmission of pain signals from reaching the brain. Each medication has multiple unique risks possible side effects and Chat Doctor. Also I would suggest Rest for some time more because Ceasing activity for a few days allows injured tissue and even nerve roots to begin to heal which in turn will help relieve lower back pain. However more than a few days of rest can lead to a weakening of the muscles and weak muscles have to struggle to adequately support the spine. Patients who do not regularly exercise to build strength and flexibility are more likely to experience recurrent or prolonged lower back pain. Hope You will find it out helpful.

I paid for a private scan on the 21st January and they believed by the size it was only 5 weeks 3 days 10days on and still no crmapingno bleeding and no symptoms? [/INST] Hello and I hope I can help you today. There are two possibilities of what could be going on with your pregnancy. If you really did conceive back in October your pregnancy should be about 12 weeks. This would have been found on the ultrasound examination that you had but instead the fetus measured only five weeks three days. At five weeks it is not normal to see fetal heartbeat so that is not used in the consideration to make a diagnosis. However it is possible that you conceived later in the cycle after your. In October. If you actually conceived in late November early December it is still possible that the fetus could be viable and that is just younger than it should be by your dates. So the way to tell the difference would be to get another ultrasound examination and approximately two weeks; by then you should see some evidence of the fetal heartbeat if the pregnancy is normal. Contrary to popular belief the majority of women do not have pregnancy symptoms. The most reliable sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual cycle. Furthermore judging the number of weeks of pregnancy on a urine tests is extremely inaccurate. Pregnancy tests are designed to pick up the hormone Chat Doctor from that whicChatDoctores out in your urine. However your urine can be diluted by different amounts of water depending upon what time in the day you tested and how much water you Chat Doctor.  Most urine pregnancy tests ask that you use your first morning urine which has the most concentrated sample however even within those restrictions there is a large margin of error. So I would advise in your situation that you repeat the ultrasound examination in another 2 to 3 weeks. In the meantime take good care of yourself for the pregnancy by: eating a well-balanced diet  </s>',\n",

The pain in appendicitis begins in the per umbilical region(that is around the naval) and then migrates to an area called as McBirney point that is at the junction of the medial 2/3rd and lateral 1/3rd of a line joining your naval with the anterior superior William spine. This area is roughly the same as you have mentioned. Further evaluation is needed. Blood counts urine examination and ultrasound scan of the abdomen are required. In appendicitis the blood counts will be high urine will be normal or show mild hematuria and USG abdomen will show an elongated or enlarged appendix. Treatment is mainly surgical however in some rare mild cases medical management with painkillers and antibiotics may be tried. </s>',\n",

[/INST] Hi Thanks for writing in. The uptake seen at L4 - L5 with hypertrophic facet changes are indicative of degeneration because of aging. Such changes occur with age and can cause mild lower back pain and spasm of muscles. A pinched nerve can also arise from this condition. You must consult a neurologist and probably also get a lumbar spine MRI scan done to know if there is a disc herniation or nerve impingement which is not seen clearly on SPENT CT should you experience severe pain in the region.

I am wondering if I may now have an issue at T-12 ? I am a male if that makes any difference. [/INST] Hi Thanks for writing in. The spine is made up of an alignment of small bones. These bones have sponge like discs between them and the spinal cord passes along the back of these bones through the spinal canal. There might be pressure on the discs in the dorsal and lumbar spine and this is causing slight pressure on the spinal canal at a particular level and causing pinching of nerve roots leading to severe pain in the area supplied by the nerve. The disc problem which had involved the T 12 - L 1 disc might have affected the discs at other levels also. Besides you also have fused vertebrae at lumbar levels. As your symptoms are on the right it is possible that the nerve roots on the right side are affected. You require to be examined a neurologist and an MRI of the dorsal and lumbar spine if indicated to know if the nerve are under pressure and the location. There are patients who get relief by doing physiotherapy and taking neurogenic pain relievers. Injections are also given for relief. However this might not always happen. If your pain is severe and not responding to medical treatment then the disc protrusion needs to be removed by doing a small surgery at the cervical neck region. Presently laser assisted surgical techniques are also available. If the pain is mild then it appears to be a minor problem that is treatable. Please do not worry. </s>',\n",

Read your history and understood the problem. It is good that you had been diagnosed and well treated for Tuberculosis of abdomen. Since you were asymptomatic for last year the chances of an active TB of abdomen is remote. The probable causes for belatedness and tightness of your abdomen can be: Intestinal sub-acute intestinal obstruction due to stricture formation of intestine; this is quite common sequel. Can be a mild gastroenteritis. I would advise you the following. X-ray of the abdomen in standing position. This is the cheapest and simplest test to see for intestinal obstruction. Ultrasonography and CT scan of the abdomen to confirm. Routine tests of blood and urine. Enterocolitis if obstruction is suspected Diagnostic Laparoscopy: this helps in diagnosis and well as therapeutically. One can cut the bands / release the adhesions.

[/INST] Hi I think you should take some medicines like camphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles' growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks. Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  Discuss with your doctor regarding this.  The problem in PCs is with ovulation. So you have to take medicines for ovulation.  Bigoted alone will not help.  Hope I have answered your question.

              " '<s> [INST] My baby is of two weeks. First week breast feeding was good enough for him however from last couple of days it has reduced a lot. Hence we started feeding lactogen but he vomits it out very frequently. What we are supposed to do to ensure he is being feed properly? [/INST] Thanks for posting on Chat Doctor. Breast milk is the best possible food for a baby and there can be no alternatives for that. Lactose or any other formula is cow milk based and difficult to digest for the baby. So in such a condition the baby often vomits it out. Try not to go for formula feeds and go for breastfeeding as far as you can. You may express your breast milk and store it in a refrigerator before you bring it to the normal temperature and give to the baby. In case of breastfeeding insert the entire nipple along with the areola (not only the nipple) in the babies mouth. Feed one breast at a time and alternate breasts with each feed. Breast milk is produced as per the demands of the baby as express through the suckling. In case of formula feeding the hunger of the baby is reduced and the baby suckles less automatically reducing the amount of breast milk produced. So reduce formula feeds as far as you can. The adequacy of the feeds would be expressed with the amount of urine passed. Passing urine at least 5-6 times in 24 hours is to be considered adequate. Hope that helps. Feel free to revert with further queries if any. </s>',\n",

Some breast cancers are made to grow faster by a natural hormone called estrogen. Anastrozole decreases the amount of estrogen the body makes and helps to slow or reverse the growth of these breast cancers.

If any of these effects last or get worse tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly. Before using this medication tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history especially of: heart disease (such as history of heart attack) bone loss (osteoporosis) liver disease high blood pressure blood clots.

Low potassium can increase blood pressure however it is usually not the sole reason. You need to be on antihypertensives with consultation from your doctor.2. Taking potassium tablets is risky. Cardiovascular effects particularly arrhythmia are dangerous. 3. You can concentrate on improving potassium by improving diet by including items like banana green leafy vegetables potatoes fish yogurt mushrooms etc. Improving potassium will reduce risk of high blood pressure stroke and cardiovascular disease.

[/INST] Hallow Dear This dilemma seems to be either due to error in the kits or personal error. Delayed positive test could be due to exceptional additional delayed ovulation from the other ovary.

First thing is you cannot wear a denture which is bigger than the size of our palate. Definitely you will have a gag reflex as the over extension of the denture is into the soft palate area leading to gag reflexes. Coming to the growth part you are already 38yrs old at this age there won't be any growth in your body parts. Only thing what can be done is asked your dentist to prepare another set of dentures which are of your size not huge and size of the teeth should be reduced and your occlusion should be checked thoroughly and extensions of the dentures are important so that you won't end up in gag reflexes anymore. Best thing is to see a prosthodontist. Hope this information will help you. Take care. </s>\",\n",

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain and give you my opinion. We talk about hypertension if we have mean values that exceeds 140/90 mmHg. Hypertension is divided in two groups: essential or idiopathic hypertension without an identifiable cause and secondary hypertension usually in young ages meaning that is a secondary cause of it. This cause might be a renal disease an endocrine problem a cardiovascular pathology. As you explain you have done all the examinations and they result normal. According to this we are dealing with essential hypertension. It is a chronic disease. It has not a definite cure but it should be treated life long. If you tell that you still have high blood pressure values despite your treatment it means that you have to rise your medication to better control your blood pressure. So if I was your treating doctor I will recommend a holder pressure monitoring for 24 h to know your mean values. After that if they result high I will add another medicament or rise the dosage of your existing ones. Hope I was helpful. Wish you good health. Best regards. </s>',\n",

I work for a naturopath but his specialty is not chemo or radiation but would like someone who will work with him in my care. [/INST] Hi Thanks for writing in. Cancer is a difficult condition to treat and treatment differs in every patient depending on the location size staging and post surgery biopsy findings. Since you have had surgery only 9 days ago it will help to discuss with your oncologist and depending on the biopsy report go for a comprehensive treatment. Even is the margins are clear there is estrogen/ progesterone positive nature and this requires you to have chemotherapy and radiation. The earliest this is started the best outcome it will have. I wish you reconsider the benefits of chemotherapy and radiation in your case and start treatment on time. Naturopathy can give you comfort and detoxify your system and it is best to discuss your treating doctor on when to take simple naturopathy procedures and wait until you are done with initial chemotherapy. Even if the margins are clear there can still be persisting microscopic invasion of cells and this can lead to flaring of cancer an few months.

I feel okay otherwise although my arm and shoulder again feel a little strange. (Although truthfully I m wondering if I m just reading into things a little bit.) I do have a history of heart issues: I had a patent foramen ovale closed in my heart in 2010 due to several years worth of strange symptoms (visual pins & needles etc.) that were likely ongoing and sporadic TIAs according to my cardiologists.

              " '<s> [INST] Hi I am 36 weeks pregnant. All my reports have been fine considering baby weight amniotic fluid & doppler flow. However my last ultrasound a couple of days ago showed the baby in a head up position with a single loop of cord around neck. Can I still have a normal delivery? can the baby turn on its own in due course of time to engage in head down position before my delivery date which is 14th Feb.? [/INST] Hello and I hope I can help you today. If your baby is in the head up position at term it is not recommended that you deliver vaginally because there is risk to the baby of birth injury. So if you reach your due date with your baby in the head up position your obstetrician will likely recommend cesarean section. However there is a possibility that the baby could turn around on its own. Ways to help this to happen is to do what you can to let your belly hang to give the baby a chance to rollover. Going on your hands and knees and arching your back high into the air like an angry cat for 10 minutes every day can sometimes help the baby to turn around naturally. However the best way to help the baby to turn around is for your obstetrician or midwife to perform a procedure called a version. In the US versions which literally are done by the doctor pushing the baby into a somersault is performed under ultrasound guidance in a hospital setting. It works about 50% of the time and can give a woman a chance at a normal vaginal delivery. Regarding the cord around the babies neck 15% of normally delivered infants have an umbilical cord around their neck. So the presence of the cord around the neck now does not mean that there will be any problems with labor and delivery if the baby is able to get into the right position. If you are considering having a version I suggest that you speak to your delivering provider about it soon as the success rates of version decrease significantly after 37 weeks. I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today and this information was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy and delivery </s>',\n",

Also getting treated will prevent your chances of getting liver cancer. If you are coinfected with HIV then you should definitely control the hepatitis B with medications since the risk of liver cancer is higher if you have both HIV and hepatitis B.

In psychology we broadly call it obsession. You had that disturbing sensation once. You expected it to happen again and focused. Then you started experiencing it as you were expecting it. Then your body brought the familiar symptom because you are expecting it. Then you started worrying that the symptom is coming again and again and expect it. Body brings it again as you are expecting it. You become worried and so on. That is obsession in simple terms. Ignore it and the problem vanishes. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement. If you require more of my help in this aspect Please post a direct question to me in this URL. http://goo.gl/aYW2pR.

For asthma management physicians need to advice various medications which depends on its severity and control.>Leveling acts by dilating air passages and relieves acute breathlessness.>On the other hand Decor which is an steroid act by reducing inflammation which prevents as well as controls frequent asthma symptoms. It has some side effects like fungal infections of mouth and throat (Candidiasis). Systemic steroid effects on higher doses like mood changes hyperglycemia smell & taste disturbances osteoporosis etc. Your son has been prescribed Decor two puffs of 200 micrograms twice daily that means a total of 800 micrograms which equals to 0.8 mg only. Moreover very little amount of steroid is absorbed as it is used via inhalation.Therefore its side effect is almost negligible except candidiasis. That is why your child is advised to gurgle his mouth with plain water after taking puffs which will prevent candidiasis.

As per your complaint bleeding from airhole can be due to infection in the area of ear-piercing while at times tightly packed earrings can lead to lack of air flow to the area of ear-piercing and can lead to inflammation and slight area of necrosis. I would suggest you to avoid wearing the earrings for a few days and clean the area with antiseptic solution and apply an antibiotic ointment over it. Cool compresses can also be relieving. You should wear earrings a bit loosely fastened so that air can flow easily. You should also wear gold or plastic earrings as they are inert materials and will not cause allergic reaction.

When depression becomes severe psychotic symptoms can appear (like hearing voices false beliefs etc.) Moreover since he was well enough to be sent home after the accident it is unlikely that he would have suffered from any significant brain damage.

I stayed in the hospital until 7-10-14. So I ve been home 5 days and the swelling has not gone done it itches and sore to the touch. Should i go have it looked at now or wait. [/INST] Hello Thanks for your query. I am happy to help you here. Today is 22nd of July. If you have swelling till today then it's better to have a follow-up. Usually snakes are non poisonous. But if snakes are poisonous usually its either cardio toxic or neurotoxic & sometimes both. Swelling doe snot confirms that the snake was toxic but it needs attention further. Although it's rare that toxin will show its action after 15 days but until the swelling subsides u need to be kept on watch. 4 views of antivenom may not be sufficient if knowledgeable symptoms appear & if no symptoms appear you may not need anti venom at all but for that you should be kept in watch for at least three days. Even if just swelling appears its considered safe to administer antivenom some patient body react to antivenom and can't be continued further. I don't think you are in trouble of having activation of toxin but still you should keep watch on yourself for following things until the swelling subsides.1) If either or both eyelids starts Chat Doctor. 2) or if you develop numbness (decrease/loss of sensation on touch.) 3)Any kind of unnatural bleeding from nose or in stool etc. If any of above complaints develop then It's must revisit ER. At the time being I recommend you to take antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication to prevent infection decrease itching and to decrease the swelling. For now I suggest you to either have a follow-up or you can take some medications as bellow. Chymoral forte once died before food for 1 wk (it will help to decrease swelling)Tab Exocet 5\\xa0mg 1 at night before sleep for 3 days (to decrease itching)Tab metronidazole 400\\xa0mg thrice daily for 5 days.

[/INST] Irregular periods mean you are suffering from poly cystic ovarian disease or pod. Cycloreg leads to medicinal stimulation of the ovaries and in turn regularizing your cycles. The effect of the medicine can continue for some time even after discontinuation. In the longer run people with pod have problems conceiving and should plan an early pregnancy.

When i finished on the toilet i noticed that my vagina was swollen (lips etc). I am also pregnant. Do you know why this happened? Please help! [/INST] Hello dear I understand your concern. In my opinion iron supplements are known to cause constipation or hard stools. Constipation is routinely seen complaint in pregnancy. To prevent the constipation:-1) Change the iron preparation- Certain iron preparations tend to cause gastritis constipation etc. So changing the brand might be tried.2)Take adequate fluids up to 3 liters per day.3)Take high fiber diet daily.4)Take laxatives if needed. Nothing to worry. It will subside by following the above measures. Coming to vaginal lips swelling check for any infection like white discharge or itching or any high BP. The swelling can also be related to excessive straining at stools. If everything is normal the swelling might be considered physiological as some swelling of vaginal lips might be there in pregnancy and subsides after delivery. But iron preparations might not be associated with swelling of vaginal lips. Anyways nothing to worry as such. Prevention of constipation is important to avoid other problems. Hope this helps.

As per your symptoms of having a red and swollen area above the upper lip and having raised body temperature can be either due to allergic reaction to any bee sting or can be due to infection like Hair follicle infection.

Two of your medicines need to be switched Singular needs to be stopped you can take other inhalations anti-asthmatic which are equally effective You are taking excessive doses of iron- I would suggest 100\\xa0mg thrice a day after meals which is most tolerated dose. You might have post-surgical bands which result in intermittent obstruction and pain that is more so a case if you are totally well in between the episodes. Another prominent possibilities is tuberculosis of abdomen. If your problem does not get resolved soon please review with your gastro-surgeon and possibly you would need an exploratory laparotomy for a diagnosis and intraoperative intervention if possible. You need a physical examination by your physician and get baseline investigations like Chest X-Ray Electrocardiogram Complete Blood Counts Renal Function Test Liver Function Test Fasting and Postprandial Blood Sugar Thyroid Profile Lipid Profile Ultrasound Abdomen Urine Compete Examination. This work up is expected to detect the underlying problem so a definite treatment could be started.  I hope this advice would be helpful for you. Still if you have any queries or doubts please write me back I would be happy to solve them. Wish you a great health! </s>',\n",

When I attended clinic I was told I wouldn t need an X-ray as they were certain from my original X-ray that I hadn t broken anything to take my cast off & get it moving again. I mentioned I had a numbness and pins & needles in my thumb but that was put down to the cast I d had on. One week later I still have a numbness/pins & needles in my thumb & my wrist continues to ache/throb. Is this normal or do I need to go back & be seen again? I don t want to waste anyone s time. [/INST] Dear patient a needles and pins sensation is generally due to a nerve compression/irritation. If it wasn't due to the cast (that's a possibility) probably your trauma provoked a hematoma pressing on a nerve (median nerve? Collateral nerve of the thumb? It depends on numbness distribution). I propose to wait a month from the trauma. If this sensation persist get an electromyography/electroneurography to objective the nerve injury. If positive do an RMN of wrist and hand to understand the cause (i.e. hematoma) and project its possible removal. Concerning instead your doubt about a scaphoid fracture I don't know which X-ray projections you did (scaphoid fractures are hard to be seen in standard X-rays). However if your wrist remained very painful for 10-15 days after the trauma a scaphoid X-ray projection or better a wrist CT would solve your doubts </s>\",\n",

Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever what is more important is the activity of the child in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\\xa0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\\xa0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

The itching is still persistent and leads to bump formation on itching think it is due to bug bite may be right it could be due to bug bite. Bump formation after itching is normal as this due to histamine release. Have you taken any treatment for itching I presume no. Take antihistamine and short course of antibiotic (since we presume this is bug bite of few weeks' duration).Hopefully you symptoms will subside in a week time. Consultation with a physician is encouraged. There are negligible chances that it could be an STD(sexually transmitted disease). Hope this answers your question. </s>\",\n",

By your history in my opinion you are having dyspnea on minimal exertion. Common causes for this are1. Cardiac causes like heart failure ischemic heart disease etc.2.

              " '<s> [INST] Hi I m 22 year old I had a implanon for 4 years nd had put a new one in April 2013 nd had it removed on June 5th 2014 what I wanna know is can I fell pregnant straight away nd is their a chance I may have a miscarriage nd I have been also having weird symptoms like my belly seems to feel a bit tight at times seem to be weeing abit nd had a day of just spotting I had unprocected sex with my boyfriend on the weekend before my implanon was removed and all so afterwards [/INST] Hello and I hope I can help you today.First I want to reassure you that it is not possible that you could have conceived if you had unprotected sex before your Implant was removed. Implanon is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy while it is in place and it takes time for you to ovulate again (at least 7-10 days) after it is removed. So if you only had unprotected sex immediately before and after your implant was removed it is unlikely you could have conceived so quickly. Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women and many of the same symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy such as nausea bloating breast tenderness headaches and irregular bleeding can also happen from an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. Many women have irregular periods after discontinuing a hormonal birth control method. So I suggest you wait for your period which should occur around 4 weeks after your Implant removal and if you miss your period a urine pregnancy test will be accurate at this time. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful. Best wishes </s>',\n",

Certainly a year of antibiotics should have taken care of most infections depending on what antibiotic was used. Unusual infections or internal infections (e.g. abscess in a muscle or organ) might cause a persistent elevated WBC as might a chronic inflammatory condition. You would probably be having other symptoms such as persistent fevers pain or weight loss if that were the case. You don't say how high the WBC count is so it is hard to assess its severity.  Be sure the Cushing disease is well treated first. If you are still having elevated WBC you might need further evaluation or need to see a hematologist to get a specific diagnosis. Hope this helps. </s>\",\n",

It was a conservative surgey. Do i need a chemotherapy? What is the survival rate with and without chemo. 5 year survival rate means the person only has 5 years to live? [/INST] Hi Thanks for writing in. It is important to take chemotherapy for dysgerminoma after surgery. Stage 1 requires only surgery because it is immature teratoma. However higher stage is best treated with chemotherapy. Dysgerminomas are usually very sensitive to chemo and can sometimes be treated with the less toxic combination of carbonation and topside. Giving chemotherapy will control the disease and prevent recurrence. Recurrence takes place in few patients even after surgery. That is why probably your doctors have recommended chemotherapy. With chemotherapy survival rates are high in the early stages. Almost every patient will respond to treatment. In cancer survival 5 year is considered a benchmark for treatment. If a patient survives for 5 years then their cancer is considered treated. Patients can live for a lifetime. Please do not worry. </s>',\n",

A cervical spine MRI study may be needed coupled with nerve conduction studies.  You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests.  Hope I have answered your query.

As you are wearing orthodontic braces for teeth alignment your teeth will take new position due to it root movements.Therefore it is best to go for gum grafts only after that.

              " '<s> [INST] My resting heart rate at the doctors office today was 132.  I have narcolepsy and am on Adderall XR 30mg bid and Adderall IR 10mg tablets 2-4 times daily for afternoon sleepiness.  My blood pressure was normal 120/77.  Should I be concerned about my heart rate?  The last time I was in the office it was 110 just sitting in his office. [/INST] Hello! Welcome on Chat Doctor! Regarding your concern I would explain that your resting heart rate values are a little high but they can be related to Adderall IR adverse effects (it is known to increase the heart rate by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system). As your blood pressure values are normal the situation does not seem to be really concerning. But I would recommend performing some other tests to be sure that everything is OK: - an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to examine your heart rate values for a prolonged time-complete blood count for anemia-thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- blood electrolytes for electrolyte imbalance. If all these tests result normal there is nothing to worry about. If your heart rate is persistently high I would recommend discussing with your doctor on the possibility of reducing the dose of Adderall. Hope to have been helpful! Wishing good health  </s>',\n",

WHAT IS IT?! Is it deadly?! Can I cure it at home?! Please say yes! WHY IS IT THERE PLEASE HELP!!! [/INST] Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint a dark purple lump next to molar tooth can be due to a dilated vein also known as Varicose vein or a Varix. The lump might be due to formation of a small blood clot that got lodged in that area forming a Thrombus. It is not AA serious condition and will not cause any serious problem. It can gradually reduce in size on its own. If it is not ruled out as the cause other causes can be like mucous cyst or Muscle Hematoma or a Hematoma. Confirmation can be done by getting a clinical evaluation done by an Oral Physician or an Oral Surgeon. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.  </s>',\n",
              " '<s> [INST] I have been experiencing hip pain/upper thigh pain that was intermittent and now is consistent.  It is more of a burning type pain.  The pain disrupts sleep and is painful while sitting still. I am a 53yr old female 175lbs.  Last year  blood work shows my white blood cell count to be slightly elevated but I have seen a oncologist who didnt find anything.  I also have been very tired and have been getting frequent headaches.  I was recently diagnosed with a autoimmune disease Vitilago.  I have seen a dermatalgist and endocrinologist.  No one has any answer.  Where do I go now? [/INST] Hi thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Hip and upper thigh pain which is of burning nature and is occurring more in sitting position especially in obese individuals (as in your case) is suggestive of NEURALGIA PARENTHETICAL. This condition results due to the compression of Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (pinched nerve) at the level of groin fold. A few conservative measures which are effective in treating this condition includes - wearing loose clothing (avoiding tightness at the level of the waist and groin fold) Losing weight taking OTC pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) ibuprofen (Advil) or aspirin Physical therapy to strengthen the muscles of the legs and buttocks etc. Other causes arising from the Hip joint are also to be excluded by having X-rays and MRI scans which may also present with similar picture. So I suggest you to consult an orthopedic surgeon for a detailed clinical examination and further management. Hope this information is helpful. Good day </s>',\n",

[/INST] Hello I can understand your concern for side effects of tattoos. After analyzing your query it appears that you are quite stressed regarding the tattoos and its side effects. Though in general if the tattoos are made in sterile procedure then there is no any harm of the same but in case if the tattoos are carved by unsterile needle or is made with infected needle then can transmit multiple infections. Temporarily it can cause secondary infection and later on the tattoos can cause permanent darkening of the skin which is actually difficult to be managed.

In your case especially the association with increased ESR fatigue and petechial suggest exclusion of a bone marrow malignancy especially a leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy might be compelling.

The symptoms as I said are very suggestive of a leukemia. An appropriate diagnosis is critical for the setting up of an appropriate treatment plan. Delayed diagnoses my make the prognosis more faint.

However it seems that you are using it even when there is no fever. Stop using it by the clock and use it only if there is fever above 99.5 degrees F. Why did the fever occur? Most likely a virus but it is safer to go to his pediatrician in routine hours within a day if possible. Use sponging as a tool to reduce fever - as your child had a fit in the past don't allow the fever to rise beyond 100 F. I hope that helps. Best wishes. </s>\",\n",

I know that I have psoriasis on my scalp. I was just wondering if it can affect my butt cheeks and also my genital area? I ve had vaginal itch since I was young. Yeast infection medicines dont work rarely will an anti-itch cream work. It was localized on one side of my vagina for 10 years and had since spread to both sides. My family doctor just says to use anti-itch but I think there s a bigger issue or a better answer. The left (original) side had turned a darker color and is thicker. What exactly could be the issue?

Psoriasis classically involves the extensors like scalp elbows knee shins and lower back but sites like maxilla groin folds can also be involved either together with the extensors or solely where it is classically known as inverse psoriasis would advise that you see a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis. Psoriasis in the body folds responds very well to topical steroids as well as topical immunomodulators like tacrolimus/pimecrolimus ointment. An OTC antihistamine once daily e.g. cetirizine would help you symptomatically with the itch. Regards </s>',\n",

It will help to know by how much your liver enzymes are raised and then treat any condition that is causing it. Since the doctor has told not to worry therefore I think the liver enzymes are not very high to cause a concern. However you might have vitamin D deficiency and this requires you to take supplement. The pap smear showing hyperplasia requires discussion with the pathologist. Hyperplasia itself does not indicate cancer but might be a precancerous stage. You might vitamin D for now.

Sorry about the attitude but I am tired of trying to find the truth about my case and because I am unable to make the living that I once made because of the Fibro I am left in the dark. [/INST] Hi thank-you for providing the brief history of you. A thorough clinical Musculoskeletal assessment is advised.a little knowledge about the fibromyalgia is needed. Fibromyalgia is a condition where the pain is in the fibers of the muscle. Each muscle is composed of multiple muscle fibers and inflammation happening there will lead to the dysfunction in the circuiting of the muscle fibers to produce the contraction and relaxation. Also to understand here that the medication is a symptomatic relief and not a long term solution as the body is a medicine of its own and medication used acts as a supportive therapy to allow body to heal on its own. Also in my clinical practice most Fibromyalgia cases we recommend physical therapy meditation and breathing exercises. As physical therapy will help improve the muscle refunctioning and also improve the metabolism and immune system to reduce the inflammation. Also Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy have been useful to reduce the pain but importantly exercises are the choice. Meditation helps improve the control over the anxiety and leads to cooling of aggression. Breathing exercises helps to improve the oxygen carrying blood cells which acts as a fuel in the metabolism and reduce the metabolic waste as well. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.  </s>',\n",

Is is very disturbing in social situations. What can I do to solve this problem? Thanks [/INST] Blushing is a common reaction. It may be a part of social anxiety disorder or social phobia. If blushing sweating along with possibly tremors or stuttering occur when you are in a social situation; you may seek the help of a psychiatrist. The other features of social phobia which you may be having are:1) Fear that people will evaluate you/ judge you negatively when you are in a social situation. Such fears are more likely in public speaking talking to a crowd or meeting many people at a party or social gathering.2) Many people have symptoms described in 1) above. But they should be severe enough to cause limitations in your functioning. Or you find the anxiety so severe that you avoid situations completely. This then leads to further social problems.3) You think this fear is excessive but seem to have no control over it. There are medications as well as Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBT) for dealing with social anxiety. The disorder is sometimes almost a part of your personality that it stays throughout life. However medications or psychotherapy will help you deal effectively with the symptoms. Do seek a psychiatrists' opinion on it. </s>\",\n",

Mirena is an intrauterine device. When with IRENA in you start getting severe pain in abdomen the cause could be:1. The uterus cannot get adjusted with it and is trying to throw it out. This is more commonly observed in women without any previous pregnancy.2. There is infection in the uterus and the device.3. The device is trying to perforate through the uterus. You will have to report to the Gynecologist at the earliest. Ultrasonography/X-ray can reveal about the perforation aspect. Rest two will have to be evaluated by the Gynecologist by clinical examination. You may have to get the device out if it is not tolerated by you. If there is infection you may require a course of antibiotics. I hope I have guided you with sufficient information. </s>',\n",

If you are a diabetic and on insulin or oral medicine then it may be due to hypoglycemia. The dizziness may be due to thiamine induced hypotension (excessive fall of BP).

But if you feel that she does not have wheezing you may skip giving it and reserve if for times of respiratory distress if it occurs. The side effect of Ventolin is increased heart rate but let me assure you that this is a very widely used medicine and well tolerated and so you need not worry about the side effects. Give your child steam inhalation twice or thrice a day and I think that she would get some relief. Also add some antiallergic syrup like Relent which will also help in diluting the cough.

When rashes appear apply a demonize cream on the face for 5- 7 days till rash subsides no longer. Use an antihistamine like HY Chat Doctor.

High blood pressure in the kidney can cause damage on the renal calyxes and can cause cyst. It requires surgical correction. Further management of the blood pressure can also prevent further damage to the kidney. Prostatomegaly means enlarged prostate. Enlarged prostate usually occurs with being prostatic hypertrophy.

The possible cause of plan is because of the tooth infection. The type of pain what you are getting is characteristic feature of pulpits. The lump could be because of the abscess formation.

What happened to me. [/INST] Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. You had choking and aspiration of food particles in trachea. Your symptoms are associated with eating. So by mistake when we aspirate food particles in trachea (wind pipe) it gets blocked. Due to this we can not get air and hence we feel breathlessness. During this episode our body is deprived of oxygen and so black out is seen. To overcome this violent coughing (reflex) is done by the body to cough put food particle. Once food particles are out wind pipe is open and you can breathe normally. So better to chew properly while swallowing. Do not speak much while eating. Hope I have solved your query.

We had IVF to conceive our first child so did not believe it was possible to fall pregnant naturally otherwise I would not have carried on taking tetrasyl. How dangerous is this to our unborn child? Very concerned and would appreciate some advice. [/INST] Hi thereTetras is an antibiotic which is not recommended to be taken in pregnancy but it is not known to cause any major defect in the baby if taken during the first trimester. Studies have shown that it effects the baby if taken after 4 months of pregnancy causing the babies teeth to be discolored and can cause hardening and cause excess calcification of teeth and bones which is irreversible. But since you are exposed to tetracycline at such an early gestation it is very unlikely to have affected your baby. Only minor abnormalities are known to occur in few women. Do not be overly concern and get a NT scan at 11 weeks and an anomaly scan done at 20 weeks to check for anomaly. Hope this helps. Regards. </s>',\n",

On your description - not painful hanging (which I assume you mean not firmly attached but mobile) and the recent onset - I can tell that there is no likelihood of serious infection or dental cyst/tumor.

Try not to disturb it though and if you develop signs of infection (reddening fluid discharge multiple sores in mouth etc.) get it attended immediately.

Phototherapy though is a good choice for extensive body involvement with plaque psoriasis however certain body sites like scalp are resistant even to phototherapy. Apart from phototherapy Oral methotrexate is a well known treatment for plaque psoriasis and can be considered in a healthy young adult. Biologics like golimumab ustekinumab are not first line options in a young patient with limited involvement with plaque psoriasis. Scalp involvement responds well to topical steroids lotions with or without salicylic acid. Vitamin D analogues e.g. calcitriol/ calcitriol lotions are also effective in scalp psoriasis.

[/INST] Hi and pleased to answer you. Throughout pregnancy the fetus bathes in a translucent pouch that gradually fills with amniotic fluid until the 35th week of amenorrhea where the amount of fluid is at its maximum with about 980 ml. Then the amniotic fluid decreases to the end to reach a volume between 600 and 800 ml approximately. The flow of the amniotic fluid signals the rupture of the membrane and the risk of premature delivery if the term of the pregnancy is not reached. When the amount of amniotic fluid is abnormally low compared to the term of pregnancy it is called oligoamnios. During oligoamnios infection rate is higher. The premature rupture of the membranes (rupture before the beginning of the work) concerns 5 to 10% of the pregnancies. Its risk factors are the same as those of spontaneous preterm birth with intact membranes. This patient received a punch on her abdomen which caused a premature rupture of the membranes and then a loss of the entirety amniotic fluid then an oligoamnios was created and during the 2 weeks before the hospitalization there was infection of the genital and baby components and infection dissemination by haematogenous route Causing endocarditis.

If you cannot read the urine test properly you should go for the serum beta-ChatDoctor titles along with a trans-vaginal sonogram to clarify the issue.

Early pregnancy may naturally have periods of episodic vaginal bleeding with clots. This is caused as the baby with the sac in early pregnancy is too small to fill up whole of the uterus. The exposed inner lining of uterus may degenerate and bleed just like a normal menstrual cycle. I am assuming that your ultrasonography after the gush of bleeding showed a live baby with evidence of fetal heart beat. In that case chance of abortion is minimal. ASA or aspirin tablets are given in pregnancy to help in free flow of blood between mother and fetus. Please write back if you have any more queries. </s>',\n",

It means the inside layer of uterus called as endometrium is present outside the uterus and it responds to the cyclical changes as inside uterus causing bleeding. As you have menses there will be bleeding from this endometrium which can be present anywhere in the abdomen.the commonest site is ovary and all around outer side of uterus.

              " '<s> [INST] My husband was on hemodialysis for about a year.  Last December we began with peritoneal dialysis at home and have been doing this for almost a year.  He had his catheter moved last June as it was much too low.  Since then he has been retaining fluid in his abdomen.  He recently had a CAT scan and a ecocardiogram which showed a heart problem which his doctor said could be controlled with medication.  While in the hospital his blood pressure dropped so low he was given a bag of saline solution which raised it but he was taken off this medication for his heart.  Now he is at home and has a physical therapist come to our home twice a week and he is doing light exercises but his biggest problem which has been with him for about three months is shortness of breath.  It is from all of the fluid in his abdomen pressing on his diaphram etc.  He has increased his trouser size by two inches.  I called this to the attention of his nephrologist as his stomach is like a big bowl of jelly.  Nothing is being done to take care of this fluid except the doctor has put him back on hemodialysis with no reduction of fluid.  Is there a possibility that there is a leak inside from his catheter or could it be a buildup of fluids from the peritoneal dialysis which I understand does not always completely flush all the fluids out of his body? Sorry about this being such a long messge but we are at a wits end as to finding out what is causing this problem.  Could you possibly help us by offering your guideance about the fluid. Thank you in advance. [/INST] HIT hanks for your query. If there is no active peritoneal dialysis going on then the abdominal fluid collection is unlikely to be related to the Peritoneal dialysis catheter. Ascites or fluid in the peritoneal cavity can be due to a weak heart or liver problems. I would recommend a 2D Echocardiogram Ultrasound of the abdomen and a diagnostic ascetic fluid tap. Based on the results we could make further recommendations. Hope this helps Good luck. </s>',\n",

Insulin is used to treat diabetes during pregnancy at all stages and is safe and effective. The disease of diabetes and high blood sugar is the part that is dangerous for the baby and good glucose control is the best way to ensure a healthy child. Good blood glucose levels should be less that 95 for fasting levels and less than 120 after meals (2 hours).  If this is the way your wife checks her sugar and you test at least 4 times daily she is under very good control and should not need further adjustment of her insulin if her levels stay at the current level.  She should be checking her sugar fasting and then 2 hours after every meal.  So in summary insulin is safe and absolutely necessary for the health of the baby if your wife has diabetes.  Please discuss the dosing regimen with your treating physician on a regular basis and make sure your wife checks her readings at least when she wakes up in the morning and then 2 hours after every meal.

This burning sensation is related to the nerve root. Due to weakness in the spinal region the nerve root gets impingement.

[/INST] Hello There could be a few reasons to your symptoms. Since your blood pressure was so low the first thought is that you were simply not getting enough blood to your brain. From you symptoms it sounds like your left hemisphere of the brain was affected given that you couldn't move your right leg and arm. Language also resides most commonly in the left hemisphere so speaking would also be difficult. You didn't mention your age but when symptoms are isolated to a side of the brain what needs to be done is an MR-Angiogram (blood vessel imaging with MRI) or CT-angiogram (blood vessel imaging with a CT) of the arteries in the neck and brain to make sure that there is no narrowing of the blood vessel that could result in the symptoms just affecting one side of the brain. If neither of those tests are possible then as a bare minimum a carotid ultrasound should be done. Alternatively but much less likely is that you could have a migraine that caused paralysis and focal neurological symptoms. They are very rare but still a possibility. The symptoms usually resolve in a few hours to a day. Lastly a seizure could have also occurred which caused you to lose consciousness. There is a condition where after the seizure it takes the brain time to recover and there can be difficulty with movement and language. Again I feel that that is less likely. None-the-less you need more testing done to make sure the blood vessel are open. Also they need to investigate the cause of your low blood pressure. It can be due to a Chat Doctor.  You should definitely speak with your primary care physician to have all of that investigated. I hope this helps. Sincerely Kristoffer Mission </s>\",\n",

[/INST] Hi Visible pigmentation in human results from the synthesis and distribution of melanin in the skin hair bulbs and eyes.Hyperpigmentation can result from excessive sun exposure use sunscreen with SPF 30. Some natural remedies are-mixture of lemon juice and cream; apply on face. Put lemon juice onto basil leaves. This is great for getting rid of pigmentation marks and dark circles that may have been a long-time problem. Apply lime (NIMBY) to the affected area and after 15 minutes wash it off. This needs to be done on a daily basis. Other remedy is Comic acid cream which lightens up the dark spots but takes some time. However mellow is a facial treatment using Vitamins and Mineral injections to add that healthy glow to skin which radiates energy and vitality. Subdermal vitamin injections rejuvenate the cells making them more active and thereby stimulating the production of collagen and elastin. Overall it reduces dark spots; effects seen faster than comic acid. You can continue same treatment for dark spots along with natural remedies and sunscreen creams. Take care. Best regards </s>',\n",

Age more than 50 is an individual risk factor for bronchitis. You are also having wheezing with shortness of breath these also favors possibility of bronchitis more. Bilateral septal thickening is also seen in bronchitis due to inflammation. So consult pulmonologist and get done PFT. PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but also tell you about severity of the disease. And for treatment severity is important. You may require inhaled bronchodilators.

Most anti-epileptic medications including Deal (Valerie acid) affect liver function however based on the information you have given your liver function is certainly improving (decrease in SGPT and GOT) indicating that your treatment is going in the right direction. However your triglyceride level is still high. I recommend increasing the dose of Amoco and repeating your lipid profile after a couple of months. In this regard I will advise you to consult your primary physician and monitor your lipid profile as well as liver function. Hope this helps. </s>',\n",

It is possible that your friend has a lowered immune status after taking treatment for multiple myeloma. This might cause him to have infection in the throat which is causing irritation to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Any infection or condition in the throat might cause the raspy voice.

This will show any inflammatory changes in the region and whether it requires treatment. Please tell him to do throat gargle with warm water twice daily to soothe the throat.

If you are able to make your studies interesting and based on variable principle your concentration level can be increased. Concentration comes only when you are interested in what you do. So please be passionate towards what you are doing or do only those things which you are interested in.

There was no fetal pole and heartbeat but a gestational  yolk sac is seen. Doctor has advised scan after 10 days and said this will be the max waiting time for a fetal heartbeat. I am advised to take hormonal tablets (Conest). I am very much worried and really hoping the best for my baby. Can you please tell me how much possibility is there for a fetal heartbeat and fetaql pole after 10 days. Thanks in advance. [/INST] Hallow Dear Usually by 6 weeks or so the fetal pole and fetal cardiac activity is detectable by ultrasound. If by 7 weeks it is undetectable there are following possibilities:1. The ovulation and conception might have occurred late in the menstrual cycle which otherwise happens 14 days before the next menstrual period.2. There could be mistake in calculating the duration of pregnancy.3. The pregnancy could be without embryo (baby). This is known as blighted ovum. In such case the ultrasonography image shows corrugated margins of the sac. If the margins of the sac are well-rounded in order to exclude the first two causes it is a good option to repeat the scan after a week to 10 days. If still the sac is empty then the diagnosis of blighted ovum is confirmed. However if the edges are corrugated it is blighted ovum. Pregnancies with blighted ovum do not grow. If such pregnancy does not abort spontaneously termination is the requirement. I hope this helps you.  </s>',\n",

[/INST] Hello As you met an accident where you were diagnosed with biceps retinopathy and supraspinatus tenosynovitis I wonder why the shoulder functions have not resumed even after 6 months. Have you taken an MRI of the shoulder? If so what was the reports? If not then please do take it. I suspect this to be a rotator cuff injury. Because any injury happening to the shoulder with two muscle injury falls in the group. The rotator cuff muscles are weak. You need to work out behind it. Shoulder function can resume only when we have good range of motion in passive for all the movements and also if we overcome the pain.  In fact I should share one of the rotator cuff injury cases of mine. It was a case of 65 years old female with the above-mentioned injury. No passive or active shoulder movements. But to overcome the problems I use to make the muscle tire by active ROM exercises and no weights. Just gravity assisted and gravity resisted ones. In fact all the shoulder movements like - flexion extension rotation abduction adduction and circumduction. At the end of the 12th week she had the best movements without any kind of pain and shoulder was much stronger than before. I will advise you to look for a competitive physiotherapist who can help you get the best outcome score. If left untreated it will lead to other pathologies which are not accepted.

He originally told me that the tumor was solo and not attached to anything when he had an ultrasound but 4 days later when they did the 2nd surgery it has wrapped itself around things in his neck. What kind of cancer does this? Is he terminal?He lives in another state and I think he is keeping information from me to spare my feelings? [/INST] Hi Thanks for writing in. It appears that your son has a melanoma that might have spread to neck lymph nodes. This is a possibility and has to be confirmed by doing a biopsy. What happens is that lymph nodes are found in many regions of the body and are small unless they are stimulated by disease process. When there is a disease in a person then the lymph nodes of a particular region get enlarged and this is a reaction by the immune mechanism. Since your son has been told that he has a melanoma it has probably involved the neck lymph nodes. The lymph nodes in the neck are close to the carotid artery and internal jugular vein and it is possible that the lymph nodes have wrapped around these. Doing a surgery in this condition is not possible and radiation usually works. It is suggested that you spend some time with your son by going over to his place and know more about the treatment he should be taking for his condition. Please do not worry. </s>',\n",

A phys therapist that was on the trip thought she may have popped a rib. She has no insurance. We can go to an urgent care facility but they dont have xray. Would that be required for treatment?  Thanks. [/INST] GREETINGS! ANSWER : Fracture or dislocation of the rib can be only confirmed through X-ray. If it's a fracture or dislocation then There is no specific treatment for rib fractures but various supportive measures can be taken. In simple rib fractures pain can lead to reduced movement and cough suppression; this can contribute to formation of secondary chest infection. Adequate analgesia can avoid this! Flail chest is a potentially life-threatening injury and will often require a period of assisted ventilation. Flail chest and first rib fractures are high-energy injuries and should prompt investigation of damage to underlying viscera (e.g. lung contusion) or remotely (e.g. cervical spine injury).

[/INST] Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You must know that Adderall is a stimulant of central nervous system. It affects chemicals in the brain that contributes to hyper reactivity. Through stimulation of nervous system in a secondary way it stimulates the electrical system of the heart. This stimulation might cause fast heart beats over 100 or generate other electrical impulses in parts of the heart different from normal sinus Rhythm. This causes premature heart contraction that we call extra systolic beats. In this situation you feel your heart like running making pauses or skipping beats. You might feel anxiety difficulties in breathing deeply palpitations or pulsations to your veins all over. Every kind of stimulation of nervous system might cause this rhythm issue to simple emotional stress coffee consumption or pathologies like anemia hyperthyroidism this kind of medicine that act directly to the system. So nothing serious is happening to your heart. it's a reaction to this stimulation. My opinions is to discuss this effects with your doctor and decide together what to do with and fit is possible or allowed to stop it. Hope I was helpful. Best regards. </s>\",\n",

Is it possible to be reaction from Veet cream?Thank you [/INST] Hello I can understand your concern for the blood in boxers of your husband after applying the meet cream. It appears that your husband has developed irritant dermatitis after applying the meet cream over the genital area. These creams are quite prone to cause the burn on the skin and therefore can cause damage leading to oozing of blood from the affected site. I suggest you to ask him to do cold compression over the affected area. Till the time you meet a family physician you can ask him to apply an antibiotic cream such as funding cream or mupirocin cream over the affected area. Ask him to wear lose cotton clothes so that it should not irritate the scrotal skin. All the best. </s>',\n",

[/INST] Hallow Madam Since you have conceived twice in your life there are very good chances that you will conceive again. However the history of ectopic pregnancy cannot be ignored and you will have to be on the guard for it. The best option is to monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography and time your sexual intercourse on the day of egg release. You will have to submit for the ultrasonography day 9 onwards for about 5-6 days. This should give you better results. If you choose to have pregnancy when the egg from the side on which tube is intact is selected the chances of pregnancy will still be higher. I hope this helps you. </s>',\n",

I have a bruise at the location of the pain -- probably because I am a student and my back is constantly being pressed against hard desk chairs. When I run my fingers along my spine I do notice a slight protrusion at the source of the pain -- I m not sure if it can be seen but I can feel it.

I understand your concern. In my opinion a disc bulge in that level of your column may be the cause of these symptoms. The protrusion may be an inflammatory lesion or just the bone related with your spinal nerves at the point of the column where they get out from the spine. Other possible diagnosis more rare may be lesions of the spine like tumors cysts etc. I would recommend you see a doctor and have a lumbar column x-ray and a blood routine test to rule out this diagnosis.

Is this a side affect of gargling hydrogen peroxide or may this be caused be something else? [/INST] Hello Thanks for writing to shy Chat Doctor.  Less complex molecules that reflect less light lead to a reduction or elimination of the discoloration of both the enamel and the dentin. The length of treatment depends on the level of discoloration and on the whitening product used. It ranges from short interventions in the dental office to applications at home lasting minutes/hours per day and repeated over a number of days. Single dark teeth can also be bleached successfully. Heavy tobacco stains may need as much as three months of treatment. Whitened teeth generally do not darken after treatment or darken only slightly and when they do retreating the teeth can easily be done. Hope this helps you. Wishing you good health...

Antibiotics quite often cause some gastrointestinal issues. Like every medicine they can irritate stomach causing stomach ache. Usually it is nothing serious however if it starts recurring some diagnostics is necessary. Swollen gallbladder should rather get better after antibiotics. So it is hardly possible that antibiotic itself has caused such issue. More possible is that your son has peptic ulcer which get irritated by antibiotic. In case of peptic ulcer ultrasound is usually useless. I suggest your son to visit a doctor once again. CRP and blood work should be done along with an ultrasound. If nothing will be found gastrostomy should be next. Hope this will help. Regards. </s>',\n",

I have a history of panic attacks and this occurs during them but at the moment I am not having an attack.  Could this be something other than stress? [/INST] Hi Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns. It is not a vein but an artery more specifically the superficial temporal artery which pulsates. It is a branch of the external carotid artery. Furthermore it occurs in anxiety disorders. Pulses can be abnormally strong when the patient has an elevated pulse pressure.  This would result in a strong bounding pulse that could also be asymmetric due to anatomic variation. Bounding pulse -commonly seen in hyperkinetic circulatory states where there is vasodilation and increased stroke output. The pulse volume is high (due to high pulse pressure) with increased blood flow. Hyperkinetic circulatory states may due to excitement/anxiety. Other causes of hyperkinetic circulatory states giving rise to bounding pulse are Hyperthyroidism Severe anemia Beri Berg (thiamine deficiency) Arterio-venous fistula (e.g. Pages disease or hepatic failure). The most rapidly rising bounding pulse is found in AR(aortic regurgitation) PDA(patent ducts arterioles) coaptation of aorta. Regards  </s>',\n",

I went to urgent care they didnt do an xray and diognosed me with bronchitis. They gave me an anitibiotic but im concerned because I just dont feel like myself and I think its something more.

Since you are a active smoker possibility of bronchitis is more for your symptoms. And you are not improving because you are not taking appropriate treatment for bronchitis. Bronchitis needs inhaled treatment. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will improve with inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or albuterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry you will be alright with all these.

They removed my cecum ileocecal valve  and appendix luckily I do not have a colostomy they were able to reconnect everything without any problems. I did have a general surgeon who actually specializes in vascular surgery do the procedure because he was on call. I have been experiencing some difficulty sleeping since surgery. I will doze off and wake up feeling nauseated and lightheaded with a weird vibratory sensation throughout my chest. Also when I stand up my vision goes dark for a few seconds.

It is always expected to feel some nonspecific gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea or stomach cramps but symptoms you're saying don't seem to be serious. If you have fever associated with abdominal pain OE extensive vomiting then you should go to hospital.  For other I suggest just to wait few more weeks.

              " '<s> [INST] Im in the hospital.  2nd case of ischemic colitis in 7 months.  Ive had 2 previous heart attacks and a moderate aortic leak.  I understand the ischemic colitis is caused by lack of blood flow to the colon.  What causes the lack of blood flow?  No doctor can answer that yet. [/INST] Hello Welcome to Chat Doctor Ischemic colitis is caused due to obstruction to blood flow of the colon. Cholesterol deposition in the arteries of the body lead to narrowing of the arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. Some subjects have increased tendency to atherosclerosis which depends on genetics and environmental factors. This causes narrowing of the arteries leading to stagnation of blood at these sites and subsequent formation of clots. This causes you the attacks of ischemic colitis. In you case since you have suffered from two heart attacks I suppose you have got high propensity to atherosclerosis may be due to genetic factors and strong family history. Treatment is blood thinners like aspirin which I suppose you are already on. Usually two blood thinners are used on recurrent attacks of ischemic colitis and even in case of previous heart attacks. So ideally you must be on two blood thinners. If despite this you have episodes of ischemic colitis you must be on higher blood thinners like warfarin. However higher blood thinners have a potential of causing bleeding elsewhere in the body. I hope I have answered your query satisfactorily. Wishing you good healthRegards. </s>',\n",

[/INST] Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Derealization disorder is not a stand-alone disorder but dissociative symptoms of many conditions in psychiatry and neurotic spectrum. It is also called Depersonalization-derealization disorder. Psychological counseling helps you understand why depersonalization and derealization occur and helps you gain control over the symptoms so that they go away. Two such techniques include cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy. Depersonalization-derealization disorder may also improve when counseling helps with other mental health conditions such as depression.

This report broadly means that you might be having hypertension which is causing pressure on heart & causing thickening of a chamber of heart (LVH).

These changes explain the back pain headaches dizziness.  Also the changes in your cervical x-ray can be explained by this diagnosis. I would recommend you have a cervical CT scan to visualize the discs and find out where the problem is. In the meantime you can use acetaminophen ibuprofen or fetoprotein for the pain and avoid abrupt cervical movements. A cervical collar can help. Hope to have been helpful.

This situtation occurs after i did abusive/lengthy masturbation 10 MONTHS ago. After masterbation or having intercource with my wife it used to come for only 2 - 3 hours and after sleep in the morning used to feel alright. But due to a lenghty/abusing masterbation session 10 MONTHS ago feeling of urination have become constant and not going away The following test are done so far. 1. Urine Culture - All Normal. 2. Renal Ultrasound - All Normal (prostate size is normal about 24) 3. CBC - All Nomral. (Dr Says very slight Iron Deficiency Anemia; dr put me on iron tablets for a month) 4. LFT - All Normal. 5. Diabetic - Normal 5. Vitamin D - I am deficient (Dr put me on tablets for a month) 6. Vitamin B - Before the onset of these symptoms i was deficient in vtamin B and had few injections of cynacoblamin were given. All the doctors are clue less as of now; these symptoms are really really killing me everyday. I have seen a few urologists with the following diagnosis and treatment but with no relief. 1. A urologist diagnosed it as non-specific non-inflammatory prostatitis and put me on Cipro for 4 weeks but to no avail after that he put me on levofloxacin for a week with no relief at all. 2. Another urologist marked it as NSU and put me on numbing jell and a tablet which turns your urine dark yellow for 5 days with no avail. I also took a TCA Tofranil (Imipramine) for about 2 weeks for no avail at all. After being exhaused from thease treatments i have also tried alternative treatments as follows. 1. Homeopathic for 2 months with no avail. 2.

Based on the facts that you have narrated you have a long-standing history of pain in urethra and constant sensation to pass urine which followed after prolonged abusive masturbation which has not responded to treatment with multiple antibiotics and none of the various relevant test are conclusive as regards the diagnosis and cause of your symptoms. In view of all these symptoms started after prolonged abusive masturbation I think the prolonged masturbation has caused trivial damage to urethra resulting to form a scarring and flimsy stricture of urethra. I would suggest you to consult your urologist again and explore need for doing endoscopic examination of urethral passage (Ureteroscopy). This procedure of visualization of urethral passage directly perhaps may help to diagnose the precise cause for your symptoms. Further treatment will be decided by him on final diagnosis. There is no possibility of pinching of any nerve as it never happens in reality. Chat Doctor.  </s>',\n",
              " '<s> [INST] I have been diagnosed yet again with another UTI with Klebsiella being the bug that is always found in my urine. The dr says it is not caught from my partner but every time I have sex with him I am back to the Drs again complaining of the same symptoms. Sometimes the urine samples show nothing but most of the time it does. Why is it that I no sooner get rid of the infection then have sex and the infection starts all over again. I m beginning to wonder if my partner is the cause of all of this. Never ever had this issue before with any other partner. I m in my 40 s and have been with my partner for 2 years and am completely monogamous (never have numerous partners). I m so over this please help me [/INST] Hello Klebsiella is mostly and primarily found in not immunocompetent individuals usually in hospital settings and cause the so-called hospital-acquired infections (HAI). They could cause opportunistic urinary tract infections pneumonia and other respiratory infections bacteremia infection of surgical wounds etcetera. In diabetics people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease etcetera. Due to their particular structure Klebsiella species are naturally resistant to penicillin-type antibiotics some Aminoglycosides (Gentamicin Kanamycin Streptomycin etcetera.). Often their treatment is possible only through the use of Carbapenems and Fluoroquinolones (Ciprofloxacin Levofloxacin etcetera.). Klebsiella is considered part of the normal flora in various parts of intestine and colon. Recent studies have reported that recurrent Klebsiella urinary tract infections are caused by persistent Klebsiella found in the urinary tract even after appropriate antibiotic treatment and all persons with recurrent infections were elderly and diabetics. Recurrent strains of Klebsiella also had increased adhesion and invasiveness compared to colonization strains (those causing infection for the first time) and this might explain their tendency to cause repeated infections. Now it is known that frequent sexual intercourse is the strongest risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections in healthy women and it is why your disease comes back each time you have sex with your partner. The fact that the disease comes back after you have sex with your partner puts in high risk of future urinary tract infections. In your case the following measures could be of benefit: 1. Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for six months by using low doses of the antibiotic that is more effective in your case. You have to consult with your doctor about which antibiotic you will use and for how long.2. Post-coital therapy by applying a single dose of the most effective antibiotic each time after having sex. You again have to consult with your doctor about the dose and type of antibiotic. 3. Apply the so-called post-coital voiding that is: urinating immediately after sex.4. You should maintain high genital hygiene as it could help as well. It is also important that you have a thorough evaluation by radiological examinations in order to rule out abnormalities of the urinary tract (anatomical or functional) that could boost infection recurrence. Lastly Klebsiella is not transmitted sexually thus clearly your partner has nothing to do with your recurrent infections. But during each intercourse it is easier for the bacteria to get contact with your urinary tract (remember that Klebsiella is a normal part of intestinal tract and colon). Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.   </s>',\n",

Please advice ASAP if i should take to subside the pain for now. Within 2 or 3 days i would be visiting a good dentist. Thank you! [/INST] Hello I am glad to assist you. The temporary filling placed would be expected to wear away if only placed to cover the tooth while expecting you to return for a root canal therapy. The filling needs to be removed to enter the center of the tooth and clean out the canals to complete the root canal. You will have a temporary filling until the canals are sealed and you can plan restorative treatment with your dentist. An antibiotic such as Amoxicillin may be necessary if pain and swelling is present. This will help control the spread of inflammation from the infected tooth. I usually recommend taking a combination of two Advil and two extra strength Tylenol to control a more severe pain until you are able to visit the dentist again. Thank you for your inquiry.

The pain is so bad and on the same pain scale as contractions only higher up between my ribs. Within the 6 weeks I ve had this pain on 3 seperate occasions and each time it s been followed by dirrahrea. It usually lasts about 2 days. 4 weeks ago I took a really sharp pain in behind my rib on my right side that went up into my right shoulder. The pain came on me very quickly and I couldn t lie down or take deep breaths as the pain was so bad I was so worried I went to a&e on arrival I had a high temp pulse over 100 and low blood pressure. Doctor did an X-ray whicChatDoctore back clear and done a ct scan as they suspected PE this also came back clear. They told me my bloods came back that I had infection somewhere but they just didn t know where and sent me home with antibiotics. 4 days later I went back as I didn t feel 1 bit better done another X-ray which was clear more bloods and tested my liver this time as they were thinkin maybe gallbladder al bloods came back clear my liver slightly elevated but nothing to worry about  I think it came back 41 and doc said its usually 36 only bloods still showed infection but doctor was baffled as to where the infection was. I got sent home with stronger anti biotics I started to feel a bit better within 2 days but I still kept the pain for about 2 weeks after. Since all this I have been to my own GP she redone my bloods  all came back clear accept my liver ggt which was slightly raised but not raised enough to do anything about. I ve got an US appointment in a couple of weeks I m really hoping I can get to the bottom of all this have you any ideas ? Do you think both these symptoms could b related?

In my opinion we should first rule out arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances in heart) because arrhythmia commonly causes palpitations and Fluttering sensations in chest. So consult doctor and get done 1. ECG 2. 2d echo 3. Holder monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about arrhythmia or other heart diseases. Pulled muscle can also be the cause. So apply warm water pad on affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant Chat Doctor.  Don't worry you will be alright with all these but first rule out arrhythmia. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks. </s>\",\n",

This may be an over worried father but my 18 yo daughter went thru a bout of meningitis that was caught early by me and I just wann be sure. this could just be a common cold right? the pain when bending the neck is what worries me but it isnt terrible pain he says its like a pinch then it goes away. thoughts? [/INST] Hello dear! I can understand your concern. The pain which you are describing can't be meningitis as in this infection the child is quite sick and is unable to flex his neck. Its probably sinusitis or could be viral flu both of which can have headache. I would advise giving him some good anti histamines like levocetrizine 5 ml at night or fexofenidine 6\\xa0mg /loratadine 10 mg once in the morning before going to school. You can also try some home remedies like 1 tablespoon of honey in a glass of Luke warm water once daily. Normal saline(2 ml) nebulization and especially steam inhalation also helps. Dnt worry he will be fine in 2-3 days with all this. Get him an X-ray PNS done and his eyesight checked because sometimes it could be due to refractive error. Hope it will help. Wishing your child a good health :-) </s>\",\n",
              " '<s> [INST] Hi I took a Dollar store pregnancy test and it came out negative but Im not sure if its accurate. Ive looked up common early signs of pregnancy and I seem to have most of them. Is it possible that the test is wrong? Or that Ive taken it too early? [/INST] Hallow Dear The routine urine test for pregnancy detection gives reliable results 8-10 days after missed period. If this test is done earlier the chances of false negative tests are high. Beta Chat Doctor test is very specific and sensitive test. It gives reliable results within 2-3 days or even before the missed period. Another test is ultrasonography. It gives direct visual evidence of the pregnancy status. However it also is reliable about a week to ten days after missed period. Hope this helps you. </s>',\n",

There are various causes of lymphadenopathy (Viral bacterial tubercular infection) lymphoma leukemia etc. You need thorough examination and set of investigations(ZN stain from FNAC and cytology) to come to diagnosis whether viral bacterial or tubercular in nature. In your case as you have evening rise it is likely \"Tubercular\" in nature pulmonary or extra-pulmonary.

Your semen analysis done very recently after reversal surgery is low. Normally there are very fewer chances of normal sperm count to be achieved and it entirely depends upon the time gap between two surgeries as the anti sperm antibodies are formed after vasectomy which kill the sperms.

As mentioned by you about the symptoms since it is vasculitis we need to have patience for the bodies mechanism to function. As treatment of choice is always directed towards the symptoms. Also as the fatigue and pain is the factor taking physical therapy will be advised as per me depending upon the vascular assessment. By passive movements of the limbs it will help to maintain the normal muscle property and metabolism of the cells. Also breathing exercises will help improve the oxygen in blood cells which will delay the fatigue and pain. Usually physiotherapy is a non-invasive and no side effects' therapy. Avoid performing massage to increase the symptoms. Also icing can help. You can discuss the same with your vascular surgeon. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.  </s>\",\n",
